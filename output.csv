h5unlnp,SimplifyMSP,0,1,"I think you‚Äôve both made good points and I partially agree with both of you. That said, I‚Äôd like to attempt an alternative way of conveying what the other guy was saying. 

I‚Äôm currently employed as a Cloud Solutions Architect for a large, but local, government organization. I won‚Äôt pretend that I understand a substantial amount of how this attack works but I feel I understand enough about *the situation* to comfortably offer this alternative explanation. 

To start, let‚Äôs look at the first area where I agree with you both. To your point, yes, I agree that the general public should be more informed about the devices they use every single day ‚Äî especially considering most of us have sensitive information (of varying degrees) stored on our devices. Unfortunately, the general public could be more educated and informed on, well, everything really. We‚Äôre currently living in a time where the outcome of a football game or winner of American Idol is more important than understanding the fundamental implementation of laws and amendments in our countries. 

To the other guy‚Äôs point, even if every person walking this Earth was as well-informed as the researchers looking to protect us from these attacks, there would be absolutely no impact to the (currently existing) outcome. You have had many of the world‚Äôs top security experts collaborating for years and the culmination of their effort can be easily summarized‚Äî*they can barely even detect it.* So, even if someone with the power to make global change was informed and motivated to make the change, that person would be met with, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you expect us to out-engineer something so sophisticated that we can barely even detect it and we don‚Äôt even know if what we have the ability to detect is a significant portion of the scale of its reach.‚Äù 

I‚Äôll end this comment by rehashing the beginning. In the big scheme, you‚Äôre right, people of all nations should be more inclined to inform themselves about the devices they use for communication. However, in this case, reading all available articles on the topic wouldn‚Äôt provide (or lead to) any measurable difference in outcome. 

The only thing we can do is hope that Apple, Google and all other mobile phone OS developers decide to implement some type of mitigation like sanitizing data to text-only from anyone not in your contacts. You may want to counter-argue that, were everyone well-informed, we could all be enraged and petition these companies to make this change together. Unfortunately, this is a basic security principle that should already be being followed and, even then, we‚Äôd only be circumnavigating 1 vector (infection method) out of the many we know exist (not to mention the ones we aren‚Äôt even aware of yet ‚Äî and may never be.)",0

There‚Äôs no sense in me really arguing any points with you, because you had your mind made up already it seems. Although it is dumb to compare an iPhone 7 to a Galaxy S20. However, I am going to bring some things to light for you. 

The iPhone SE is not $1500. Apple offers a HUGE selection of devices. All ranging from like $1300(12 Pro Max 512GB) all the way to around $350-$400(SE 2020)

Your disdain towards Apple seems to be irrational, but I digress. 

Whatever floats your boat really. The Galaxy is a good phone, but in five years, it won‚Äôt be supported and performance will be all but gone. I‚Äôd venture to say if you had a new battery slapped in that 7, it would wake it up quite a bit. 

If you‚Äôre after a S20 FE, you‚Äôre obviously not after a spec‚Äôd out phone, so even then, you‚Äôre not going to be spending $1300, definitely not $1500. Not sure where you got that number. Unless you don‚Äôt live in the US and it‚Äôs more expensive where you are. 

The S20 FE is the equivalent of the SE 2020, my sisters and mother all three have the S20 FE. Like I said previously, it is a good phone, but longevity, reliability, and ease of use are not there. It‚Äôs super easy to be in the Apple Ecosystem because of how streamlined it is. I get it‚Äôs not for everyone, and I understand you may not like it. I personally do, so it works for me.

Ultimately it's not their OS, and they can't 100% guarantee Google will not change the requirements to something unforeseen that renders it impossible to run on older hardware. It has literally happened to them before.",1
h5ut9st,drome265,0,4,"Short answer: Yes, if you pay full price, no if you can get any sort of discount. 

Long answer: 

Flagships are always, always, better than their non-flagship counterparts*. 

For myself, the biggest contributor to a phone feeling ""cheap"" is whether it struggles while switching apps or taking subpar photos. Any sort of lag will cause frustration, additional taps, and just not a very pleasant user experience over all. 

Example - take a photo, crop it, save it, share it to chat app of your choice. If the phone hangs up at any stage, this contributes to feeling cheap. 

This is why phones like the S20FE/Asus Zenfone series are so popular, because they deliver 90% of the flagship experience without the massive sticker shock. 

I picked up a new-in-box S10+ in Sept of 2019 for $550 and it has delivered and is still going strong to this day. This is the way to get the flagship experience unless the new model has something you REALLY want.

h5q5muu,fakegriffin32,0,2,Samsung's been doing that for a while so I'm curious how he got burn-in with the AOD. I've owned an S8 and a Note 8 and never had that issue.,0
h5q5r17,-brently,0,1,"I'm guessing they haven't either. 

I have the pixel 5 with beta and holy cow the AOD is so nice. Not only is it not too bright or obtrusive in any way, they have made it so the clock changes when there are notifications so it's even easier to tell when you have something new than it was before. 

This is one feature I think google did incredibly well. Never had a Samsung one some here are complaining about.",0

They‚Äôre not purposely designing software to make older devices run slower, the software is just built to keep up and take advantage of newer hardware instead of making it optimised for outdated devices. The old devices still perform rly well in my experience, my iPad Pro from 2015 also being an example of a device that still runs rly fast despite its age.

I never said they did. (Purposely that is)

But they also don‚Äôt give people the option to just buy a phone and use it for the rest of it‚Äôs physical lifespan staying on the software that it came with.


If they did, an iPhone 6s would be just as fast today as it was when it was new, sure the battery life wouldn‚Äôt be as long, but thats an entirely different issue. We‚Äôre talking about phones slowing down. 

For example I have a 2013 iMac. And it‚Äôs running High Sierra it runs wicked fast. Zero complaints from me.

I have tried installing more recent versions of MacOS on it, but those slowed it down and provided me basically no obvious benefits. So i rolled back to an eariler software. Which thankfully is an option on MacOS. 

But its not an option with iPads and iPhones.

I have an iPad Mini 2 collecting dust in a draw, because its slow as shit on iOS 12.

I personally consider it to be unusablly slow, even for the simplest of tasks and apps. Its a real shame i cant roll it back to the iOS version it shipped with where it would at least make for a good e reader or simple mail/safari device",0

This is not a post asking for help. There's no known fix to this other than spending $$$ to send my phone in to Oneplus' shitty service. This is just a discussion post about a known issue that the oneplus sub doesnt want to talk about  
  
This will be my last OnePlus device after owning the original OnePlus, 2, 6, and 7pro but that's besides the point.  
  
So a couple of weeks ago, my front camera stopped working outright. When I would launch the camera app, it would show a black screen and crash. This happened with any and all apps that used the front camera. I didn't drop my phone or anything, it just stopped working one day. I was on an earlier version of OOS back then and thinking it's a software issue, I updated the phone to the 10.3.7 version I'm at currently. But no dice.  
  
Okay, fine. But 3 days back all of a sudden, now my back camera including flash has stopped working. Any app that uses the camera freezes and crashes if I bring up the camera screen. For some reason Amazon app and YouTube aren't working either (Amazon just shows a blank screen and youtube shows a continuously refreshing screen)  
  
What are these insane issues? I can't understand what nonsense this company has done to render some of the most important parts of a phone entirely useless. I have seen some more people having this issue. Some were quoted as OnePlus wanting to replace the entire motherboard, for some the front camera had to be replaced, and for some both the front and the back camera.  
  
For anyone looking to buy a OnePlus phone, Fuck OnePlus for being the shittiest phone company ever. If your phone works fine, it works fine. But the second you have an issue, you're straight out of luck. And believe you me, you'll have issues with their phones. I've had issues with all their phones and in the past I ignored some because of the cheap value proposition which isn't the case with my current phone and their current offering",1

I'm the same--but its want more than need--and you have to remember we don't represent anywhere near the average (we are on a subreddit dedicated to a mobile phone operating system after all...). 

The fact is it should be up to the consumer to decide when to upgrade (within reason). Many people would continue to upgrade every couple years, many would keep their devices longer (as many already do well beyond the end of official support), but it should be your choice when you are paying $300-1000 for a phone.

 

&gt;That's nuts to me, you will be SO behind on features,

Features like what? What killer *hardware* features would be hard to live without between phones 3-5 years apart?

I won't argue a new phone won't have many small and some bigger advantages over a 4-5 year old phone, but I think (with a few exceptions) the idea that there are massive jumps in hardware capability year to year is more marketing than reality these days. 5 is a stretch, but not unreasonable.

I'm chomping at the bit to upgrade my phone after 2/3 as well, but its definitely much more 'want' than need, and after the new toy excitement wear's off the differences (apart from maybe battery life and possibly camera) aren't that meaningful (to me--but this will depend on how you use your phone).

I have a pixel 2 right now, literally the only justifiable reason I have to upgrade is Google stopped pushing updates to it. The camera is great, the battery is (somehow) still pretty solid, its not sluggish in any discernible way. If I had my my way, I'd hold off a year or 18 months, and pickup the current cutting edge now, at a discount in a year or so.

There are good reasons for someone to want to upgrade every couple years, but there are also good reasons for someone to want to upgrade much less frequently. We've conditioned to think the 2 every 2 is the norm, but its frivolous for most average people.",1

You can set up automatic restart also in MIUI. There is an option for scheduled turn on and off. If the phone is on when a scheduled turning on is coming, the system will reboot instead.

There are four possible reasons for the iPhone ‚Äûslowing down‚Äù

1. Recent update - the iPhone needs to do some re-indexing behind the scenes, which takes time, CPU and battery power. Solution: wait - it will pass in a few days, rarely up to a week
2. Full or almost full memory - iPhones use a few gigabytes of ‚Äûfree‚Äù memory as a cache to speed up some tasks. Take that away and the iPhone will feel more sluggish. Solution: free up a few gigabytes of memory
3. Deteriorated battery - when the battery is old enough, it‚Äôs no longer able to support peak performance. This leads to the iPhone shutting down randomly despite the battery showing some charge remaining. When the iPhone detects that, it applies a low-pass filter to its CPU in order to prevent the loss of capacity from affecting the use time and the phone from shutting down prematurely. Solution: replace the battery and the iPhone will run like new (been there many times)

h5mkfcg,TheGoldenBoognish,0,24,"SANTA ANA, California ‚Äì An Orange County man was sentenced today to 24 months in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle counterfeit Apple, Samsung, and Motorola cell phone components from China that were then sold to consumers in the United States, a scheme that generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue.

Chan Hung Le, 46, of Laguna Hills, was sentenced by United States District Judge Josephine L. Staton, who also ordered him to pay a $250,000 fine.

Le pleaded guilty in November 2020 to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, to intentionally traffic in counterfeit goods, and to illegally bring merchandise into the United States.

From late 2011 to February 2015, Le conspired with other individuals to import from China cell phone parts and other electronic items bearing counterfeit marks. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Le set up and used mailboxes with virtual office service providers in Oklahoma and Texas using a fictitious business name, JV Trading Solutions. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Le also used the name and identity documents of one of his employees to set up the virtual offices and directed other conspirators to ship trademarked goods under Le‚Äôs employees‚Äô or relatives‚Äô names. Once the counterfeit products arrived, Le and his co-conspirators distributed the parts to the public through various online stores.

‚Äú[Le]‚Ä¶orchestrated an elaborate scheme to deceive customs agents by creating covert shipping channels from Hong Kong and China to different U.S. states,‚Äù prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. ‚ÄúFrom this conduct, and this deception, [Le] generated millions of dollars in profit. [Le] enlisted numerous other parties in his conduct ‚Äì including his romantic partner, his employees (witting or unwitting), other family members, and the unwitting virtual mailbox service companies. This was a sophisticated, long-standing, and highly profitable offense.‚Äù

In 2016, one of Le‚Äôs suppliers, Hongwei ‚ÄúNick‚Äù Du, pleaded guilty in United States District Court in San Diego to conspiring to traffic in counterfeit goods and related money laundering charges. In his plea agreement, Du admitted to selling Le at least $18,744,354 worth of cellular telephone and electronic components for resale from China into the United States and that about half of the goods were counterfeit items bearing the trademarks of Apple, Samsung, Motorola, and other companies. Du was sentenced to three years in federal prison.

Homeland Security Investigations, United States Customs and Border Protection, and the Westminster Police Department investigated this matter.

Assistant United States Attorney Cameron L. Schroeder, Chief of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, and Assistant United States Attorneys Lauren E. Restrepo and Victoria A. Degtyareva, also of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, prosecuted his case.",0

In a matter or 20min they can change your icloud and email passwords and remove the device from your account, so there is basically nothing you can do. Some delivery apps cover not only restaurants but many other possibilities including cash delivery (which in theory is useful) but that in the hands of criminals can do a major damage, besides the whole bypassing bank security part (that uses face/touch id). Most of the time placing a report at the police station will be useless as these are so common they don't bother investigating. my insurance has even removed smartphones from coverage because it started to be a matter of WHEN it will be stolen, not IF... I am always amazed at how people in Brazil are extremely clever and resourceful finding alternative ways for doing things, unfortunately this goes both ways and most of the time the alternative way involves assholery. Social inequality sadly and obviously has a huge impact on this becoming more common. It's pretty sad.",0

h5mpjy4,Solarek817,0,1,"There‚Äôs a few key differences between 11 and 11 Pro:
- the screen - 11 has a 6.1‚Äù LCD screen, which is similar quality to your 6S in terms of sharpness and blacks, while 11 Pro has a sharper OLED screen, which has true blacks and more vibrant colours. Overall the difference is there and you‚Äôll be able to see it side by side, but using the standard 11 will be perfectly fine
- the design and build - that‚Äôs the most noticeable difference between the two. The 11 has aluminium frame and is slightly thicker than the Pro, it also has thicker bezels around the screen, which can make the phone feel a bit clunky and unwieldy. Also the 11 Pro is slightly smaller with a 5.8‚Äù screen and smaller bezels, which helps with one handed use. The standard 11 feels a bit closer to the Pro Max size
- the cameras are exactly the same between the two, only the 11 Pro has a 2x optical zoom lens which is pretty handy for the close-ups, but not a complete necessity 

You might want to check out Apple‚Äôs refurbished options, they might have the 11 Pro at a reduced price there. The refurbished phones are a great deal imo, the only thing that‚Äôs used in that phone is the inside, everything else (the battery, screen, shell) is brand new. 

Normally I would recommend the standard 11, however you said that you don‚Äôt really like bigger phones, and the 11 really feels like a big phone between its weight and size. In that terms the 11 Pro seems like a more sensible choice. 

The jump from the home button iPhones to the new ones is pretty easy honestly. The gestures really feel intuitive, my mom who recently got a 12 mini got used to the new gestures in a matter of a day, and she‚Äôs not a techie at all!

However, if you go to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; Back Tap, you can map various things to the gesture of tapping the back of your iPhone twice or three times. That‚Äôs probably the closest you‚Äôll get to making control centre more accessible.",0
h5mrvvg,Pachydermal_Platypus,0,2,"You can‚Äôt always just ‚Äòput a bigger and bigger battery‚Äô in every single iPhone, you kind of have to make compromises on your hardware and design if you want it to perform. You can‚Äôt just make every phone extra thick, most can already barely reach across the iPhone 12 with their thumb, and many can‚Äôt even do that on the 11. They already had to increase the size of the normal Pro iPhone 12 just so they could barely fit in a battery that was a few mAh smaller than the 11 Pro because of the 5G components. Besides, seeing the previous comments, people would complain that Apple put in batteries that were too small anyway once the current gen gets affected by the throttling from the degraded batteries. The previous gen iPhones from years ago had batteries that performed perfectly fine during their run. Current Android phones are the same, as well as their previous years. Their batteries performed fine, even great for their run. Their run was just half a decade ago.

The throttling disappearing isn‚Äôt bullshit, it will go away as long as the battery can support that peak performance. The battery will degrade again as batteries do, and the software will, again, make sure that it doesn‚Äôt have to restart or crash every time you try to open clash of clans or smth. I had an iPhone 7 for just about 4-5 years and i could run it smoothly without crashes until I decided i wanted an OLED display and a larger phone. I haven‚Äôt had to replace the battery in the 7 a single time, so that having to replace the battery after owning one for more than a year is BS. Meanwhile, my friends Samsung A-(forgot) from 4-5 years ago shuts down or restarts on every other attempt to open clash of clans, and crashes his browser 2/5 times while opening it without having received a single software update since it was 2 years old.

Apart from that, heavier and more intensive software also is more demanding on the old-ass hardware thats in the older iPhones, so you can‚Äôt expect the same phone to perform exactly the same across its lifespan, not to mention newer hardware also making it look like older hardware is slowing down, when it really hasn‚Äôt by any noticeable metric because of the speed differences between SoC‚Äôs.

So far, considering my Mom has had her iPhone 8 repaired before and I‚Äôve had my iPhone 7 checked out, the waterproofing seal has been highly reliable after collecting it again.",0

It will give you a pop-up, but you can choose to ignore it, and it won‚Äôt brick your phone to ignore the pop up. Its nowhere close to being Windows.

An iPhone with a replaced battery will perform pretty much as it did on day 1, but you can‚Äôt expect that sort of consistency over 5+ years with hardware degradation over time.

Firstly it has a weird new effect when you touch on things, but initially I thought there was a graphics bug because it looks weird (some sort of pixely effect happens when you touch things).

But most importantly. the notification toggles, On 11, you can see many toggles all at launch but with the new one, you can only see a few and the buttons are huge and have text besides it. So much wasted screen real estate. 

And the settings page is just as bad with increased vertical padding and huge font sizes so you see even less then before.

Needless to say, I will prevent my Pixel from upgrading to 12. Also the performance was pretty bad. but that MIGHT also have been because of the beta.",1

SD cards can get real fast for sequential stuff, the problem is that most mobile devices does not have the reader capable enough to take advantage of them. Besides, for media consumption, even the cheapest SD cards have read speeds well over 30 MBps, which is double that of the highest quality 4K bluray rips. Write speeds on the other hand wildly varies. 10MBps writes are possible on almost any half decent SD card these days. That's going to be mighty slow to copy stuff into.

They want their phone to get the best reviews and the longest review is probably a year so they choose a high cut off. 

And it's way better to be able to select a voltage/percentage on the spot and have your phone charge till that then stop. 

That way you only charge as much as you need and on days that you're going to be out for a long time you can still charge it with a 4.2 volts but only charge it to lesson for it any other day and have three times longer battery life.",1

h5ie4ro,TheGoldenBoognish,0,137,"After several reports of criminals unlocking people‚Äôs iPhones and managing to access users‚Äô bank accounts in Brazil, the S√£o Paulo state police were able to arrest one of these gangs.

According to Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, four men were arrested yesterday and accused of integrating a specialized gang in unlocking mostly iPhones, accessing users‚Äô bank accounts, and then stealing their money.

This is one of the most famous and sophisticated gangs operating in S√£o Paulo city, based in the downtown region. They are able to exploit smartphone security flaws and even bypass Face ID, Touch ID, and alphanumeric passwords through specialized software.

According to Police Chief Roberto Monteiro, with pirate software bought on the deep web, the gang is able to extract people‚Äôs iPhones data.

‚ÄúFrom the moment they managed to unlock the phones, the gang evaluate what‚Äôs inside of them. If the people have bank account information, they use another software to take off the data and then start to steal their money,‚Äù said Police Chief.

Over 80 police officers, 38 cars, and 10 specialized teams with the help of a police air unit and three teams of Metropolitan Civilian guard members were able to access a building reported to be the number one place where the criminals sent people‚Äôs robbed iPhones to be unlocked.

Although 9to5Mac recently published a story about how some of these criminals were able to steal people‚Äôs iPhones data, the police officer says this time is different. While some criminals use reverse engineering and are able to switch the SIM card to another phone, in yesterday‚Äôs arrest, the gang uses specialized software, which could be similar to what some governments use as well.

Following the previous reports, Apple has promised the Brazilian newspaper that it will make it easier for users to delete all data from a stolen iPhone. However, the company did not give details of what exactly it will implement. With iOS 15, users will finally be able to track a powered-off iPhone using the Find My app, which could also help.",0

h5hruxq,stevenseven2,0,3,"&gt;Apple's M1 chip, on the other hand, as well as most of their iPhone chips, are just literal generations ahead

I wouldn't go that far. Apple's 2x performance lead peaked with A10. Their generational performance improvement has stagnated more than ARM's. ARM has closed the gap gradually since A76, and we should not forget that. Where they are  way behind, though, is in efficiency cores.

My issue is people not understanding that we know which CPU that is in Whitechapel. It's using 2x A78 cores, 2x A76 cores and 4x A55. Not some ""Google Silicon. We also know that it uses AMR's Mali GPU, and that the SoC is made on Samsung 5nm.

It's basically Exynos 1080 (2x+2x A78 + 4x A55) with a bit inferior MC performance. Similiar to SD780 also (2x+2x A78 at \~15% lower speeds + A55). Is this bad? If it means a cheaper phone, then not at all. As Pixel 5 vs 4a, both on SoCs virtually similiar in performance, showed, storage speed has a far greater impact on real-world performance.

Yes, customization allows for some improvements, as QC displayed with Galaxy S21 with SD888 vs. Exynos, which was first time since forever both used same CPU setup on the same process node. And as you clearly see, the differences aren't major. But QC implement ARM core the best; why would we think Google would be any different than Samsung/MediaTek?

Where do google go custom? Their own sceurity chip (Titan M) and NPU (Pixel Neural Core). Whereas PNC was an addition to the already-existing NPU in the Snapdragons before, Google might only use their own, instead of Samsung's, to save space. That's maybe the biggest differentation I can see happening. And it's not big...",1

h5hu8jk,nokeldin42,0,2,"It's actually the norm in India (for electronics). I've never seen any store accept returns for any electronics. The amazon buy and try thing I see on reddit all the time makes absolutely no sense here. They'll offer a replacement if something's broken, but no refunds at all after purchase. If you're buying electronics here, you have to rely 100% on reviews. Which sucks because I can count the number of reliable reviewers across the entire tech industry on one hand. And often, they won't have reviews for India specific SKU's and reviews will often come months after the launch, because that's how much time it takes to properly review a complicated device like a phone or a laptop or even a TV these days.",1

h5hun65,Scrypt-N,0,3,"There's a few factors involved. It's an ARM device which isn't a great architechture to mine on compared to desktop GPUs, it's a lower end processor, and it would have to run in a way that the user wouldn't notice major battery drain, heat, performance loss, etc, or they would risk getting caught.

All together translates to a negligible hashrate. A flagship device today can mine a penny per day of Monero (~100h/s) at full power which makes the phone basically unusable while mining. So a low end device (~30h/s) with a miner running unnoticed in the background (maybe 20% mining power max, ~6h/s), would make $0.0006 per day, or $0.22 per year if running 24/7.",1

h5dabvy,MarioNoir,0,10,"Not a surprise. Xiaomi makes really great hardware, it's very hard to match their ability to make phones with good specs and build quality for such low prices.
I would say at this moment their weak point is MIUI 12 and I'm talking about stability and optimisations but of course they can just improve their software with future updates and I'm sure they will do that because they won't have a choice.

I recently bought my wife a Redmi note 10 pro. A really great phone. I wanted something with a good screen, camera and battery at a good price and honestly RN 10 Pro doesn't have a lot of competition in it's price bracket.
For photos I installed Gcam right away and it works great being able to use all the lenses. Nigh sight also works with all the lenses. The thing that I find disappointing is the lack of video stabilisation at 4k 30fps.",1

h5djh92,nybreath,0,1,"This gives me headache.  
   
In order to preserve battery life, and keep a healthy battery, I use daily an 80% battery. But the problem is, why do I keep a healthy battery and then use always a 80% battery?.  
  
So, I am thinking preserving the battery is good so when I know I will need more juice, like a trip day, I can just switch to 100% charge.   
  
But then I ask myself, charging to 80% daily, how many times will happen that I didnt charge to 100%, I didnt know I needed juice and I find myself with a dry phone?.  
  
My thought is, is it worth to always use a reduced battery to preserve it, risking to find myself dry?. Is it better to use daily a 80% battery, or is it better to use daily a 100% battery that will eventually go to 80% health?.  
  
I dont know, I really personally prefer to not worry about these things, to not worry if tomorrow I need a 80% or 100% phone, the battery wearing problem also takes years to become relevant, for all things considered and peace of mind, I really prefer to care at a normal level, maybe change the battery after a couple years, and leave it alone.",1

You're right. But I can get the same AP story from a some local newspaper or television station in a format that doesn't throw terrible ads at me, even if WaPo won't let me see it on their website. I'm not attached to specific papers in that way (though I do enjoy some of their feature stories). 

&gt;But of course none of this is a personal obligation to turn off an adblocker. But the macro-level answers to all these questions have some important effects. Obviously it‚Äôs a sweet deal to be the one with an adblocker in a world where everything is free-with-ads. But if everyone uses adblockers, the model necessarily shifts to something less sweet than that.

I'm curious what that ""less sweet"" option would be. At some point, people will stop engaging entirely with annoying or expensive news choices, even if there isn't a better option for the same content.

Outside of your WiFi being really unstable, it should still use less battery.

Cellular radios need to be stronger since the distance between your device and a cellular tower is considerably greater than the WiFi in your home. Additionally, you have no real choice in selecting a specific tower to lock onto, as this is managed by the cellular network. So you could very well have 5 bars of signal but still bounce around cell towers around you to ensure that.

h54vrrf,-jak-,0,-6,"You seem somewhat confused by this. My statement is _not_ contradictory to that of the American Heart association. They don't talk about anaerobic (high intensity) training _at all_.

A high intensity interval session is _very_ different from a steady medium intensity session, even though the average heart rate is the same. The former will be taxing on your body, the latter you won't notice much.

Here's an American source on it:

&gt; HIIT workouts are more exhaustive then steady state endurance workouts. Therefore, a longer recovery period is often needed. Perhaps start with one HIIT training workout a week, with your other workouts being steady state workouts. As you feel ready for more challenge, add a second HIIT workout a week, making sure you spread the HIIT workouts throughout the week.

https://www.acsm.org/docs/default-source/files-for-resource-library/high-intensity-interval-training.pdf 

HIIT training daily for 3 weeks is a form of overtraining, and we all know what that can do to the body - overuse injuries, weakened immune system (in the middle of a pandemic), 

Here are more Americans agreeing on that https://aaptiv.com/magazine/hiit-every-day",1
h54vvmx,parental92,0,0,"nah, nintendo is never into hardware race.  They are all about just making nice software complementing the hardware they have in hand.   I mean they are using an ancient ARM processor for 3ds until quite recently.

I am also not cherry picking ‚Äî I am just giving the most popular bad example. But even Nintendo's own games like Breath of the Wild can't hold 30 FPS in all areas ‚Äî and I'm not even talking about the Korok Forest, since even just running through the fields has microstutters all over the place. After playing it at 30 FPS locked on CEMU, the difference is very much noticable.

\&gt; Xcom 2 runs quite well on switch

\*\*skips to the actual gameplay\*\*

28, 26, 24, 22, ooh single digits!, 30, 32, 26 ‚Äî yup, runs ""quite well"" indeed. I mean, it's essentially a board game so FPS doesn't quite matter, but I wouldn't recommend this as your sole experience with the game.

\&gt; Most switch games looks and runs better than mobile equivalent. Just because it's optimized for 1 hardware.

I know of one ‚Äî GRID: Autosport. And that's only because their graphics settings are very conservative on the mobile, and you need to swap in a separate config file to achieve parity with Switch. And then you can play Switch ""graphics"" mode at 60 FPS on modern phones, while Switch can only do 30.

Civilization VI, for example, looks much better on my S10+ than on my Switch.

\*\*\*

Switch is very much underpowered for what Nintendo is asking from it. And I honestly don't think buying third party games on it is worth it ‚Äî unless it is your only gaming device. You can get much better experiences for the same price elsewhere.",1

Apple, and other companies, include software locks on a piece of hardware that you legally own. That means that if you actively work to bypass that software, not only can they sue you, under the DMCA they could have you arrested. Imagine buying a car but the car dealer puts a lock on the door and says the car is 100% yours. You have to change the oil, pay taxes, licensing fees, pay for maintenance, and if it breaks you have to pay for repairs. But if you try to remove the padlock they put on the door you can be sued or arrested. That only the car maker can tell you what you can and cannot do with your car. As long as you only use the car the way they want you to, you'll be fine. Oh, and that they can change the terms at any given time AFTER you buy the car, and change everything. Of course, if you don't like those changes, you are free to sell it or just not use it.

If that was the case, then you would never have to jailbreak your phone. Jailbreaking your phone was upheld as legal by the courts, but only the end user. The actual act of exploiting the locks that allow for jailbreaking can technically be a felony under the DMCA. Apple routinely sues or goes after anyone who even remotely encroaches on that level of their control. I don't understand why people keep acting like Apple/Samsung/etc are the victims here. You are free to keep using their overpriced repair services if you want, nothing about any of this is going to change that. It only applies to those of us who actually want to control out devices and are sick of a company telling us what we can and cannot do with our own property.

Legally speaking, and I think you're going to see this at some point, if I own my device I should be able to remove anything I want from the device ... including the OS. No different than a PC/Mac ... I can remove the OS that comes on it and install whatever I want.

Personally, faceID as a security measure is nonsense to me. Security should require a willful action to access the biometric imprint. If all someone has to do is point the phone at my face to access it, that's not secure. Apple does a great job at blocking people from getting INTO your phone from the outside.

You're talking down to people when you use language like that. It's majorly condescending and just flat out unnecessary.

Nowhere am I assuming that people are using the beta. In fact, that's why I put the disclaimer in the first place. You stated you wished a feature existed, I checked and saw that it did, shared that with you with the beta disclaimer and encouraged you to check for yourself since I couldn't verify otherwise.

If you want someone to elaborate, instead of ""You can't read..."", try ""Could you elaborate?"" This is basic conversation stuff, so don't try to explain away your rudeness as if it is my fault for not saying enough.

h517m1z,fantargia,0,2,"It's important to note while right to repair is talking about replacing hardware, the crux of the issue is *software*... the code that on the device that prohibits switching that hardware out.

&gt;their position that an end user owns the device?

You do not own the software that runs on your device, from the [iOS end user license agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/iOS14_iPadOS14.pdf):

&gt;The software \[...\] that came with your Device \[...\] collectively referred to as the ‚ÄúApple Software‚Äù **are licensed, not sold,** to you by Apple Inc.

h517odm,Solarek817,0,1,"I don‚Äôt think the XR will get obsolete fast, Apple still sells devices with its processor (the budget iPad, iPad mini) so I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll get years of support. 
12 mini is an awesome phone, but you‚Äôd get similar battery life as on the SE, which would be a serious downgrade from the XR. 

I agree the XR is a bulky phone, but if I were you, I‚Äôd either stay with my XR for a bit, or get myself a standard size 12, which is thinner and lighter than the XR, but still has decent battery life. If you plan to upgrade I‚Äôd say you should wait for September - new iPhones mean the older models will get cheaper.",0
h5187j7,Solarek817,0,0,"Coming from 11 to 12, I didn‚Äôt feel any difference in terms of performance, the camera upgrade is pretty small too IMO.

I ended up just waiting it out a couple months, because I know I'll kick myself if I paid full retail just a couple months before a new model comes out.

So, MOST people are over the yearly release cycle rush? Let's be honest, my parents still use a couple of iPhone 6S, and the batteries are still in great condition (they're both pretty new). Performance wise, they're great.

I suspect that looking up which apps have updates might be more costly for Google than I previously thought - maybe new uploads by the devs are initially placed on storage that is more costly to read from in numbers - and they're trying to give it time until that update trickles out to most users.

h50hxoj,ScramDread,0,3,"Bought an ASUS ROG 5 12/256 phone (out of *curiosity for entire gaming phone idea*) and proven myself that it gets real HOT (**45+ celsius** sending unpleasant hot tingles across my hands and comfortable gaming is beyond the ""*comfort*"" at this point, more like hold device long enough until match ends without burning my hands) under load. Now attempting to pick a cooler for it to solve the heat generation issue and those were the best in their class according to YT videos:  
1) Black Shark FC 2 Pro.  
2) RedMagic Dual Core Cooler.  
3) Asus Random Cooler Inefficient Cooling Edition (or whatever official cooler name is... removes only 3-4 degrees of the heat at best, but... comes with 2 more buttons to press!).  


Now... i would have picked option #1 because reviews stated (and avoid bothering reddit) it is extremely effective, however my small study of the matter led to discovery of ""peltier element"" in construction of this particular (Black Shark FC2 Pro) unit with negative (or at least this video here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9SDTHHOSxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9SDTHHOSxY) showing it forming ice crystals and having -13.9 celsius surface temperature ) temperature on the side responsible for cooling the back of the phone.  My inner warning alarms went off after vids on youtube showing drops of water (And they were generous in their number) forming on the different tested devices\`s (not only ROG 5) back plates which led me to question:  
Am i going to brick my phone with these ""peltier element"" coolers that thanks to solid temperature difference (40-45 or as some others say 55+ celsius on the ROG 5\`s back and 0 degrees ""produced"" by the cooler) might create condensate on the inside of the phone (ROG 5 has zero water resistance... but i am not sure it might matter with such approach) and short circuit something (expensive and not covered by warranty most likely)?

h4we5me,Relay_Slide,0,2,"A $1500 iPhone isn‚Äôt just that price because of the company or the government alone, it‚Äôs a combination of both. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone, but if you really want to blame someone for whatever stupid reason, then blame all parties involved. Your $1500 iPhone has lots of economic factors involved in deciding that price in any country. Manufacturing, shipping, etc. Then add Apple‚Äôs profits and then add tax. 

As for the difference in iPhone prices worldwide, the price of an iPhone isn‚Äôt X plus VAT, it‚Äôs X plus VAT **plus Apple charging extra as well** depending on the country. This all depends on lots of different factors. It‚Äôs absolutely pointless looking for someone to blame. 

And you know what? Nobody cares how it‚Äôs broken down. All anyone wants and **needs** to know is what it will cost you. So why would you think it‚Äôs a good idea for a company to advertise the price at X amount, when the customer won‚Äôt be paying that amount. 

Our government doesn‚Äôt hide costs. We know our VAT rates and can see them as we buy an item. The difference here is that our **advertised** price is the actual price you pay. A company can‚Äôt advertise an item at $1000, only for you to pay $1500, after VAT, import duties, tips, service charge, or whatever else is added on. That‚Äôs just dumb and pisses people off. 

Speaking of which, what is included in the price you see in the US? Do you get import duty added on at the checkout? What about service charge? The stores cut vs the manufacturer? There‚Äôs a lot of things there that might be ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by your definition, but I don‚Äôt agree with this definition. Why are some things ‚Äúhidden‚Äù and others not? And even if all these ‚Äúhidden‚Äù charges weren‚Äôt included until the point of checkout, what‚Äôs the point? If you care about all this, you‚Äôre still going to have to read the receipt, **just like we do here**, except your advertised price just isn‚Äôt correct. Sales tax isn‚Äôt the only thing you can ‚Äúhide‚Äù.

AGAIN, why are you assuming I‚Äôm looking for someone to blame in the first place. An iPhone costs what it cost. If I‚Äôm buying an iPhone I‚Äôm not looking for someone to blame for it‚Äôs price. If I‚Äôm not happy with the price I just won‚Äôt buy it.",0

A phone that ticked pretty much all the boxes on paper is the Sony Xperia 1 III.

The only reason I would buy a new phone is the screen because the original one broke when it was just 6 months old and the replacement (unoriginal) screen is really bad.

h4wdn9n,mbc07,0,8,"Currently using an Xperia X, bought back in the beginning of 2017. Battery life isn't great (it was acceptable when it was new and overall bad nowadays, despite having the battery replaced last year) and it is starting to show slowdown issues from time to time (especially when hot), but I'm keeping it as long as it still works. 

I'm running the stock Android 8.0 firmware with September 2018 security patch. There are quite a bunch of custom ROMs for it (up to Android 10, last time I checked) and they're overall quite stable, however I stayed on stock because the NFC doesn't work for payments in these custom ROMs due to an unknown bug that makes the HCE part to not work (I can pass SafetyNet checks just fine on the custom ROMs and can successfully setup cards in Google Pay, but when you try to pay it just errors out due to this bug -- other NFC features do work, though).

Why I'm keeping it? I've never really been fond of the whole ""more screen, less bezels"" trend of the last 3 years or so, just didn't care, however things definitely went way too far when the OEMs started crippling core features just to brag they trimmed another half mm of bezels with the next phone. What did it cost? Screens with punch holes or weird notches (absolutely unacceptable for me -- thanks Apple for starting the trend), front firing stereo speakers are virtually gone and front cameras really, **really** suck nowadays. 

Just compare to my Xperia X, it has a front facing camera with a bigger sensor than most flagships nowadays (13 MP, f/2.0, 1/3"", 22mm), it also has autofocus which is gone from most selfie cameras. The stock camera app isn't great, but I did some tests with GCam and a custom ROM sometime ago (stock firmware doesn't work with GCam, unfortunately) and I could get selfies on par with today's flagships. That's just bonkers, the front camera from a premium mid-rage released back in 2016 being able to perform on par with the ones found in flagships released 5 years later (when paired with the right software).

I really wish I could buy the newer Xperias, I would gladly pick any model they released after the Xperia 1/5/10 rebranding, but Sony Mobile left my country a few years back (last one released here was the Xperia XZ2), with Sony Electronics following suit earlier this year (only Sony thing left here is the PlayStation). With Sony out of the game, the only other option sold locally without a crippled screen is the Asus Zenfone series, but I got hands-on with one of them and they're just way too big for my liking and severely overpriced here, and the flip camera, although robust, is another moving part that can potentially break over time, especially considering I usually keep a phone a lot longer than the norm (that's about 4+ years for me).

**TL;DR** I really despise the notched and punch-holed screens from todays phones and the other downgrades associated with that move and I refuse to upgrade until non-crippled screens becomes the norm again. Hoping that when my Xperia X finally dies (it was already a nightmare sourcing a new battery for it last year) under-display front cameras already have became mainstream so I have more options with regular screens to choose from...",1

I was one of the original IPhone owners back in the days and remember fondly how I was blown away by how amazing and innovative it was. It simply blew every competition out of the water. I went up to IPhone 4 before yellow worms on the screen and a horrible battery ended my journey, so I switched to the Note 3 with amazing battery life. I've been using samsung ever since, simply because of its batteries, but now I recently had the opportunity to get a free pair of air pods and now I feel Apple pulling me in. The thing is, and this is where it gets weird I know. But I consider buying the new SE because of the following reasons. For the price I can also get a series 6 watch instead of only the new S21. I loved the original IPhone with the home button and it seems like it will be the last with this feature. Also a big fan of the rounded edges. I am a bit scared of how much the battery is being flamed but I love the product red and would be willing to get the product red smart case for the SE if that would make a significant change? I know the s21+ battery at 4800 mAh is a lot better. But the sleek design, and fear of not getting to have one last ride on the nostalgia wave is making me consider go against simple no brainer login when it comes to specs. But please, for the sweet love of I don‚Äôt know, tell me I am crazy or if it makes just the tiniest bit of sense.

When the turn is approaching, it uses your current average speed to calculate in how much time you'll reach that turn and about 30s before it tells you, ""in 700m turn right"" and then again at about 7 seconds out ""turn right""

The only time it combines two instructions is when the turns are close by and within 10-15 seconds of each other. ""turn right then turn left"".

h4sb11f,khopdi_tod_saale_ka,0,1,"The only serious concern with Samsung is data collection.

Other than that they do everything right. I am currently using one of their phone with 6000 mAH battery and they manage to fit that bugger in just 186 grams phone. That's insane since the Xiaomi competitors were selling 220 gram chunkers with just 4000 mAH battery.

Also they support devices properly for years. Yes, majority of the devices only get security updates but that's still enough. I do not expect them to work to update the version of Android on a $200 device and yet they sent one Android update and the rest are security updates. That's amazing when competitors like Xiaomi just sell you a phone and forget any updates.

Also Samsung UI fixes most of the shortcomings of Android. They have an extensive set of features which Android for whatever reason lacks. Samsung also has a one handed mode in every way possible with almost all the native apps designed with buttons at bottom in mind.

Then they also have features such as Dex which Google should have had it by default at this point.

Resale value, in my experience, largely comes down to the brand value more than anything else.

h4khn4x,Glittering-Wafer-263,0,1,"Lol, you do realize this problem also affects OnePlus and some Samsung phones if you did a quick Google search... Ive used the S20 Ultra/note 20 ultra, S21 ultra, OnePlus 8 and 9 Pro, iphone 12 Pro and some others, and hands down the Pixel 4 XL is a much better device in all real world usage.

Pixel Launcher/experience feels like things are actually baked within the UI and not on top like some android skins. From animation consistency, to pop ups and gestures they all look uniform and natural, and not like its added extra. Not to mention OneUi on top of android takes nearly 30+ gb of system storage alone, while its less than half as much on pixels, which definitely helps with the aging process as the larger the OS, the more demanding and resource hungry it tends to be.

Not to mention less quirks on stock android like bugs, funky gestures or certain apps running in 60hz instead of 120hz like oneplus/samsung devices support, but apps like google search, or YouTube run at 60hz while the rest of the UI is at 120hz and look janky and unnatural, especially YouTube its most noticeable.

Pixel experience is also much cleaner, no funky large colorful icons, no bloatware or excessive running services, which Samsung's built in RAM cleaner under ""device care"" does absolutely nothing and is a waste of resources, as cleaning the ram under ""device care"" does nothing but re opens all services that just got closed...

Things like camera consistency and computational photography which involves shutter lag, color profile, HDR processing, portrait and multi frame photo stitching algorithms for increased detail used in gcam, highlight control etc. The S21 Ultra is great, just not as consistent or reliable as the Pixel is. Other Pixel exclusive features like assistant features, hold for me, call screening, Feature Drops, monthly security updates and bug fixes, and other Pixel exclusive features that aid in daily use.",1

in terms of how this translates to watching movies on our phones. from what i understand 120hz is not really in play when we stream movies because 120hz is more for refresh rate and scrolling etc and when we watch movies on our phones the refresh rate actually drops to save battery life etc.

That being said most of the time it is placebo.
The need for lossless isn't so much the difference in quality, but it's knowing that you are getting the best possible audio quality. This itches your ""what if"" quality scratch and eliminates one more factor in the set up equation.

Take one of the flac/mp3 audio quality tests online and see if you can tell the difference, most in the audiophile space cannot differentiate the two accurately with audiophile gear.

I wonder instead if they'll try and get Windows 11 on the device and then inelegantly run Android apps through the new Microsoft Store via Amazon. Either way, here in the UK the Duo is still extortionately price ($1582 for the base model), so as much as I'd like to pick one up that is not gonna happen.

The thing is, Apple has lost its many crowns. Battery life and performance wise and you know the videos yourself most likely. It's just that, so that people keep the iPhones on the top, people hang onto minor details, just like you just mentioned.

Worst of all you can't even disable so many of those useless Xiaomi apps. Plus, the system apps themselves have ads in them. And Xiaomi deliberately puts in dark patterns to try and prevent you from disabling it's ad tracking. Like it makes you wait 10/15/30 seconds to enable the disable tracking button in some cases.

Coming from Oxygen OS, this is honestly sickening. Although my next phone won't be OnePlus because I'm not a fan of their offerings at the middle/lower end, I do appreciate the clean software.

TL; DR, if you want a clean unobtrusive software experience which doesn't hassle your mom, do no go for Xiaomi.

h47nrdh,karl_w_w,0,2,"&gt; It's a mode in the camera app meant to be a point and shoot experience.

According to who? Basic to me means basic controls, not point and shoot. If you want the phone to automatically take the best photos you use... auto. If you read the blurb the phone gives about the 2 modes it tells you this.

&gt; This was clarified in the YouTube comments- he did, he just didn't put it in his video, but his conclusion remains the same regardless.

By this logic there is no point in putting anything in the video, he can just do an audio podcast telling us what he thinks of the phone. But actually people want to see what he's talking about.

&gt; Sony literally markets the phone

Who cares how Sony markets it? He's a reviewer and we're consumers, we should all be caring about everything (or whatever we want to) not just what Sony tells us to care about.

&gt; ""cinephiles""

This refers to the screen not the camera.

&gt; Ultimately, it's a lie- he discusses (etc)

I wouldn't call that discussing, Linus's *unboxing* went into more detail on the non-camera aspects than this review.

At the end of the day my original point still stands. This guy made a very flawed review. The mic mistake demonstrates an ignorance of how smartphones work at a very basic level. The use of basic mode shows he doesn't know how to operate the phone. The colour grading issue means his video can't be trusted to visually represent the real world experience of using the phone. The focus of his video being 90% on the camera suggests that he likely didn't put much thought into everything else.

This is compared against my experience of holding an extremely similar display in my hand and finding the screen sufficient in very bright sunlight. *Any one* of those 4 flaws in his video would be enough to throw doubt on what he has presented on this subject, all of them combined make it worthless to me.",1

h43wg1m,TheEclipse0,0,1,"When the iphone 12 was announced, I was very much in love with the device. However, I was finishing up college at the time and couldn't justify splurging for one while my iphone 8 still worked just fine. Fast forward to today, and my iPhone 8 drains 30% of its battery, while in my pocket, during my morning commute. I have to turn it off for most of the day, and its becoming apparent that it is probably not going to last much longer.  I was hoping to upgrade to an iphone 13 this September because I like to stay on top of tech, but I may be forced to upgrade sooner.

So there's the 12 and the 12 mini. To be honest, I really dislike how big phones have gotten in recent years, and so the form factor (and the price!) of the mini is the VERY attractive to me. It would be a done deal, except for I'm really worried about battery life. Now, I've seen the benchmarks and frankly, they don't strike me as a typical use experience. It's like, ""we turned 5g on, and turned the brightness to 150%, and visited a new webpage every 30 seconds, and concluded the mini is bad because it only lasted seven and a half hours.""

So, like... I just don't know if a mini is going to cut it because I'll be using it differently than I used my 8. Since I've reentered the workforce, I now have this huge commute. It's about 2 and a half hours everyday, and I feel as if playing games or streaming music would go a long ways in making it far more bearable than it currently is. In addition, I typically use my phone throughout the day for heavy web surfing. It is important to note that my provider does not have 5g, but it is coming at some point during the next year.  

Given the above information, I'd like to know if I should go with a mini, or if I should just go with the regular model?

I also have some extra questions:

a) Because I was in college when I got my iphone 8, I opted out of a data plan. I'm also Canadian, so all the providers gouge us. I was wondering if 6 gb of data is ""enough""? I don't really plan on streaming movies or anything like that, and while I'm at home, I'll be on wifi.

b) likewise, is 64 gb enough? I've had my iphone 8 for 4 years (I think) and I've only used about half the total storage... But since I'm going to be loading tons of apps onto it, and will have access to data, I'm sure I won't be able to conserve as much space. I'm kind of thinking that icloud offsets the need to buy higher capacity models.",0

h44a0cg,DiplomatikEmunetey,0,1,"I was (and still am to an extent) a big fan of smartphone cameras and thought they are about to dethrone real cameras. Then I got a Sony RX100 MK1. It's got 1-inch sensor but it's a camera from 2012! Here's what I realized: smartphone cameras are nowhere near real cameras, nowhere! Real cameras give a very different look to photos, much more natural and pleasant; you can always tell it's taken with a real camera.

Smartphone cameras besides looking more processed and digital, simply do not have the lens quality and versatility to match. I've realized that the lens matters A LOT! I would even say more than the sensor size and that's something smartphones cannot match because it needs space.

I've gone in a complete opposite direction now; camera used to be my main determining factor in buying a phone. Now I prefer a no-gimmicks simple phone that takes great pictures to a cameraphone with possible compromises and I want a separate camera for quality.

Phones are convenient, they are always with you, they are very quick and you can take a snap with them instantly. Also, the great thing about them is that they are automatic; people who have no idea how to take photos will get much better photos with a smartphone than a camera. It'll probably look less real due to HDR, but all the details will be captured. If you know how to use a real camera though, you'll easily blow away any flagship smartphone.

Especially video, smartphones cannot change aperture size, that means they cannot follow the [180-degree rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule). This means smartphone video, especially in bright sunlight will always be much less pleasant than a real camera's.",0

 &gt;In filmmaking, the 180-degree rule is a basic guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene. By keeping the camera on one side of an imaginary axis between two characters, the first character is always frame right of the second character. Moving the camera over the axis is called jumping the line or crossing the line; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as shooting in the round.

It doesn't offend me. What I find irritating is that somehow you consider your anecdotal evidence as fine but not from other users. 



&gt;The proof is out there for everyone to see 

Show it then? 


&gt;Your only argument is large screen size, which shows just how hollow it is - every phone has a large display now.

I am just telling what I have seen people praise it for. And infinix do have biggest phones in their segment. If that doesn't appeal to you, fine. But don't act like there is some spiritual aspect to phones that's missing here. 



&gt;All phones have some compromises. Samsung used to offer shitty hardware in that price range, Xiaomi had shitty software. Software was fixable to some extent, which is why I went with them.

So you do liked them. You choose them over other options. 




&gt;Profits do. Sales are meaningless without margins.

The holding company of infinix went public last year. 


&gt;And good of you to completely ignore the quality part. I guess you know you can't keep defending this crap.

What quality part have I ignored? 



&gt;This is not opposition. The number of comments here are tiny. 

Because the company is tiny. 



&gt;""Probably"".

Yes



&gt;Source, please. Also, revenue numbers while you're at it.

This is where it's a good idea to use something like 6 completely randomly chosen *dictionary words* for passwords, because they're much easier to type than something like 15 random *characters* that include special characters and mix upper and lowercase.

r/thathappened

&gt; So you do liked them. You choose them over other options. 

If I liked them I'd have still used their phones. I bought their phones out of necessity, not because I liked being showered by ads in settings, notifications, lockscreen and first party apps.

There's a difference between liking something and buying something out of necessity.

&gt; The holding company of infinix went public last year. 

When we talk about OnePlus, Oppo or Vivo etc, we talk about their performance, not BBK's.

&gt; Because the company is tiny. 

Which is a function of most people choosing other phones over theirs. If they were so good and popular like you tried to suggest, surely that would reflect in their sales and by extension, profits and market share.

&gt;r/thathappened

?? Do you seriously think I am just talking out of my ass instead of knowing people who own and like infinix phones? 

&gt;If I liked them I'd have still used their phones. I bought their phones out of necessity, not because I liked being showered by ads in settings, notifications, lockscreen and first party apps.

Just because you didn't like all aspects of the phone doesn't mean you didn't like them. Nobody forced you to buy that and there were options, you choose them because you liked certain aspects of them. 

&gt;There's a difference between liking something and buying something out of necessity.

There were other options, why you didn't go with them? 

&gt;When we talk about OnePlus, Oppo or Vivo etc, we talk about their performance, not BBK's.

True. Since they are not a big player in India, It was hard to find their numbers. 

&gt;Which is a function of most people choosing other phones over theirs. If they were so good and popular like you tried to suggest, surely that would reflect in their sales and by extension, profits and market share.

Dude when I ever tried to suggest that it so good or popular? In my other comments I have specifically said that even in budget segment, you would encounter more realme and redmi than infinix. What I have said is that they are consistently increasing their market share. 

&gt;Could've easily said you don't have sources to back up your claims. Claims which you justify by saying ""probably"".

Or you could google yourself and find. I have already stated most companies who do market research are aggregating all of the phones of Transsion holdings. 

&gt;I never said you made that claim.

Then what are you insinuating in the comment? 

&gt;No, but if they were as popular as you have been insinuating, they would register at least somewhere, and no at the bottom of the pile.

They are popular and getting more sales, just not enough to register in such lists. Don't know which of my comments gives you the hint that Infinix is among the most popular brands in India.",1

h40728h,PrunedLoki,0,11,"Yeah I‚Äôm in DevOps and if people had an option to just bug me whenever they wanted to in person, it would be quite distracting.  I do a thorough job of checking all the slack channels I need, my notifications are tailored to help me know when something important is happening, I don‚Äôt need someone walking in and starting a chat because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to type up a short paragraph.  
As far as my team is concerned, we have our slack channel and have decided that if we feel like the conversation on slack is insufficient, we hop on a video call.  Our team also consists of people in different countries, so obviously us getting together in person is impossible on the daily basis, and forcing us to go to our each respective office would be idiotic.  If anyone has mental difficulties because of staying at home, then they are free to go in and use any open desk that‚Äôs available.  
And of course not every position is the same.  That‚Äôs why having a blanket policy for all employees simply doesn‚Äôt work.  Team leads should be able to dictate these things as needed, but they also should be forced to provide adequate reasoning if they expect their team members to be at the office.  
All this takes a bit more work and and effort by the companies, but your employees are your bread and butter, so fucking make it work.",0

Apple either keep their crown jewels on their internal secure network and maybe allow secure remote access or local access only...OR they'd put it on the cloud and access it directly via SSL TLS encrypted comms and zero trust authenticated access. This is the way.",0

You see the frame work for disingenuous design flaws like a 2013 model Mac Pro being sold in 2018 as a new model and it literally across the entire product line cannot do what it was the damn thing was designed to do which is render 4K video and yet the company for half a decade continued to market it as a viable tool for video rendering knowing the devices firmware was not compatible with the third party products namely the GPU which caused consisten failures with software rendering video at 4K (Premiere?), or how about the throttling scandal? All of that stuff is perpetrated by the office assholes and it‚Äôs left to the people working at home and sometimes in office too, to deal with and I gotta tell you taking constant abuse for shit you didn‚Äôt do 8 to 10 hours a day and making just enough so that you can‚Äôt really better your life in any meaningful way but you can maintain a ridiculous sense upperclass white collar existence because you‚Äôre pounding keys instead of nails, but still struggling just the same to keep your head above water. In some cases. Give it time. It will mean the collapse of the company. They‚Äôve already been redefining themselves as a ‚Äúservices‚Äù company as opposed to a product manufacturer for years now. Like your iPhone? Other than the OS you‚Äôre just buying Samsung parts at a much higher cost and that‚Äôs been their business model for decades going back to when they just made computers with more expensive versions of windows software preinstalled. 

Maybe if all these people get what they want they‚Äôll stop jockeying for position within the company and start focusing on doing things of value again like making products in the country they originated in. Just this bullshit executive class nonsense. When all you have left is just your bullshit executives and management class and no one else left who genuinely wants to do the actual ‚Äúwork‚Äù that‚Äôs a pretty good indication you‚Äôre in a failing fucking state. How do you know? Customer services has been plummeting across the board for years. Why would you want to provide your best level service to self entitled assholes who cannot be bothered to learn how to use their devices but would rather call someone on a phone like a child crying out for it‚Äôs mother and then persecute those whose job it is simple to provide information, because they cannot rematerialize right there before them and fix all their problems in an instant. Seriously I‚Äôm not even getting actual real accounts and I have so so many. It‚Äôs all bullshit and none of them deserves anyone‚Äôs time. Apple has literally become a blight on the world and if you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôll do your part and just go direct to source with Samsung or buy a flip.

h4009mm,JustEnoughDucks,0,3,"Because GCam is just an apk. It's kind of misleading to say ""a port for X phone"" All a gcam port is, is putting the proprietary blob libraries in the package, and creating a settings tune for Y camera sensor. (Still an incredible amount of debugging, refining, debugging, refuning, etc... props to all the gcam devs)

Gcam has most of the proprietary blobs in the _libs apk for Xperia, and you can enable Sony it in the settings, and then it is just tuning the XML. That is where Samsung comes in. The main sensor on the S20FE is pretty much a less-premium version of the one on the Xperia mkii series. It has the similar color settings, similar problems, etc... which is a pretty decent use-case for using the same  XML but changing the blob settings to Sony.

 Yes, it's not completely perfect or stable, and there is no ""perfect tuned version"" of the XML for the Xperia series, and a couple in-depth functions may not be worked out yet to play nicely. If you actually looked into the project and saw the updates they had given, most things do work just fine on the Xperia mkii series.

I‚Äôd often have 5 failures in a row and lock the phone for 30 seconds.

I have an iPad Air and iPhone XS. Touch ID on the air is pants. The XS has trained me away from using it, so I swipe up and stare at the air like an idiot until I remember it needs me to awkwardly put my finger on the top of the device. Authentication for locked apps or Apple Pay is less seamless than it should be because it requires moving your hand around the device til you find the spot. Yes they put visual cues there, but it breaks the continuous user journey that the XS and newer phones gives.",0

h3whqpp,ProtonPleasurePipe,0,3,"I personally think (and hope) Apple may go the route of Sony on this one and put it on the lock button. There‚Äôs demand for Touch ID but few people are willing to go back to having the hardware taking up potential screen space. In screen just doesn‚Äôt seem to work consistently, which leaves the lock button or back of phone, and I can‚Äôt see them compromising the aesthetics of an uncased iPhone by slapping a reader in the back.",0

But if you have a thick case around your iPad Air that makes the button harder to reach‚Ä¶fuck is it unreliable.  Though this is definitely a design flaw by the company who made my case. The powerlifting on my phone is so much easier to press even though it‚Äôs in a thick case.",0

Though, also subjectively better, as I actually *have* both phones (got a Nord N100 as a gift recently) and still choose to use my OnePlus One currently as my primary one since the community support for the Nord N100 isn't quite there yet and I much prefer rooted LineageOS with TWRP, system-wide ad blocking, a battery charge limit, a software navigation bar that actually matches the colour of my keyboard correctly, and without that weird bug where I can't hold shift while entering passwords. Also, somehow the camera is slower and laggier on the Nord N100 even though it's a much newer phone‚Ä¶ And the screen has slightly fewer pixels. Everything else, is only slightly better, like the RAM, which is only 1GB more.

Countless bugs that were never fixed until the release of Android 11. And now they  are gonna extend it even further? I mean it's a good initiative, don't get me wrong, but I'll wait and see for the coming 2-3 years before I am going to consider them again. Let's see how the 8 series and 9 series are treated when the 10 series and beyond are released. 

If they drastically improve, make more stable software at a more regular basis, then that's fine and I'll praise them. But until then, I'll be sceptical. Length of software updates and quality/stability of software are 2 entirely different things and people should learn to recognize that.",1

h3s78j4,The_Frozen_Inferno,0,2,"Apple is both right and wrong about this. 



On the one hand the environmental angle is definitely BS and we all know it. They save money shipping the phones and they save money not putting a charger in. None of which are savings passed on to the customer. 



On the other hand they were right in saying the large majority of people have multiple charging bricks laying around already and to just keep handing out hundreds of millions more that will end up in a drawer somewhere is being wasteful. Demanding our 10th charging brick in the box just for the sake of saying they gave us one is a little silly. I for one have more than I can find uses for. Besides they always gave us the cheap 5W chargers that are below the standard for modern fast charging phones so I always end up using the higher wattage non-Apple ones I have instead. 



The real slippery part is when you buy a new iPhone and the only thing in the box is a USB-C to lightning cable. Sure we all have charging bricks already but like 99% of them are traditional USB-A plugs. Seems like a little mind game on their part trying to get you to also buy the Apple USB-C brick so you can use your new cable (which they certainly don‚Äôt seem to mind packaging, shipping around the world, and selling. ‚ÄúSave the environment‚Äù shipping iPhones more efficiently but cancel some of that out by shipping more chargers at the typical huge Apple markup).  



I wouldn‚Äôt give them the satisfaction of buying their USB-C charger. I‚Äôd buy a third party one from a company like Anker instead and get a just as good or better product for less. But again, I and many others have too many chargers around already so buying more only wastes more packaging and whatnot. If you don‚Äôt have many devices and actually do need extra chargers then spend the $20 on a quality 3rd party one and not only will you get something much better than the cheap junk they *would* have given you but you can give business to a company that deserves the profits more than Apple does.",0

Ok. first time i have heard anyone saying that foldables was a request. Most people already complain at 6'' phones being too large. I could understand if a foldable was a 3'' phone that can turn to a 6'' screen while taking less pocket space. But all iteration i have seen are already large phones that turn into a tablet...why...

&gt; Periscope cameras, super fast charging, VRR screens, new oled screen technology, under screen finger print readers, under screen cameras, and so on. There has been plenty of innovation.

Ok I admit to my unawareness on what some of these here. 

But fast charging is again the battery thing I mentioned before as important and where innovation is still needed.

Underscreen fingerprint readers and cameras are of course ""neat"" from a tech perspective but they don't really bring anything new to the table in terms of functionality. No one was unhappy at regular fingerprint readers or cameras. (No I don't count the notch/hole/chin complainers..)

Periscope cameras i thought you ment the pop-up ones lol. Now i can see it is related to zoom which is cool.

VRR screns or oled screens tbh are again gimmicky. On 5 or 6'' devices? come on, phone screens have been great for over 10 years now and there's barely any noticeble difference from my sony z3 to a S8 or the newer phones.

&gt;I know I'm in the extreme minority on this sub, but I have no problem with them removing the headphone jack.

I don't disagree with that one. But tbh it didn't take any reasonable space inside a phone. Have companies used that space for larger batteries? most haven't.

And of course it is true  ""It's one less part that needs to be water resistant, one less thing that can break"" is a thing. But that only applies if that cost reduction would have been passed to consumers which it wasn't.

AMD has never made a GPU for this form factor before, and especially on Samsung fab controlling power consumption will be really hard. This isn't TSMC where things will just work out.

Okay, let's say it is better. So what? The GPU is the least of the problems of Exynos SoCs. The bigger problem is that they still are at a CPU deficit compared to Qualcomm and at lower efficiency to boot. CPU is what's going to affect your day to day performance and battery life, whereas GPU on the phone will only be of benefit to those who do smartphone gaming. I'd take a 10% faster/more efficient CPU over a 100% faster/more efficient GPU in a phone any day of the week.

And the CPU gap is going to widen up since Samsung is stuck with ARM stock cores and Samsung foundry while Qualcomm has access to both ARM cores and custom cores with Nuvia acquisition, and access to both Samsung and TSMC foundry. For their next gen chips, Qualcomm can just shift to TSMC 4/5nm and absolutely destroy Exynos chips if they want to. And if Samsung fab gets better with 3nm GAA, they can switch back.",1

Their smartphones have Samsung-made RAM, UFS, batteries, displays, camera sensors and even Samsung-designed SoCs made in Samsung fabs. They are literally the only company in the world able to do so. 

Even their smartwatches ran Samsung's own OS because WearOS was disappointing. And Samsung's smartwatch marketshare shows how they prefer to be in full control of the entire experience, and not at the mercy of a contractor. 

And now even Google, had to partner up with Samsung for the new Wear OS. 

*Google, a software company, had to partner with Samsung, who isn't a software company, to save their wearable platform.*

Even One UI is a good example. It's distinct, and yet it introduces so many features that Google takes forever to implement onto Android. 

Samsung has a very clear history of not wanting to rely on other manufacturers, and wanting to control the entire experience, and be market leaders. Their deep pockets allows them to spend so much on R&amp;D and keep going at it, while for other companies that aren't as big as Samsung, has much bigger risks to take if they do so. 

If Apple would attempt to try go into OLED manufacturing or semiconductor fabrication, despite them being valued more than Samsung, they are both such highly specialized industries, that it bleed so much money in their attempt to get something up to their standards to recoup costs. 

In regards to the Exynos thing, there's good reason as to why it still exists in this day and age. Samsung clearly still has a vision to have fully Samsung powered devices and be the leader there, so it won't be surprising that Samsung drops Qualcomm. It brings competition in this field too.

h3s5gpm,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,1,"&gt;Ok. first time i have heard anyone saying that foldables was a request. Most people already complain at 6'' phones being too large. I could understand if a foldable was a 3'' phone that can turn to a 6'' screen while taking less pocket space. But all iteration i have seen are already large phones that turn into a tablet...why...

Lots of people have both a phone and a tablet, and would love to be able to replace those 2 devices with just one. I do a lot of travelling, and would love to only have to take 1 device, especially when going overseas on holidays.

VRR is variable refresh rate, ie the refresh rate isn't just 60hz or 120hz, it can match the content that is on screen and drop down when displaying static content. The new OLED screens are amazing compared to 5 years ago.

&gt;But that only applies if that cost reduction would have been passed to consumers which it wasn't.

No, it applies because the less things that can break the less chance you have of your phone breaking.",1

I'm very aware of the fact that Apple too will use (some of) my data to market stuff to me. However, they are making the specific point of not using my individual data, but rather use aggregated forms of this privacy sensitive data. Apple also makes a point of storing and processing as much as possible on the device itself. Which causes people to feel it's a lesser experience than Google will give them.

My point is, it's good to have faster charging, but there's a point where the returns don't really cover up what cost you. It's such a niche thing to need your phone charged in 10 minutes. Half hour or maybe 1 hour is probably enough for most cases. That too if it doesn't degrade the battery that much. Funny you were talking about Samsung's fast charge while I've even the 25W fast charging disabled on both my phones. I'd rather have the little extra longevity than faster charging.

RCS is a GSMA spec, not a Google proprietary protocol. The whole point is to allow service providers to interconnect thier media services using modern IP protocols. It's also designed to be extensible. New features can be added on a regular basis and still be backwards compatible. 

RCS and the technologies it relies on is more than just about text messaging. Its a system to allow mobile devices to recognize unique capabilities across carriers (VoLTE? VoIP? Video? Resolution?

&gt; Depending on your target audience, it might go the other way...

&gt;... because I am not going to pay for software that is a hassle for me to install on my devices, which is what this change makes all paid apps in the Play Store that adopt this new method. 

...and...

&gt; Having said that, if it encourages more developers to accept payment independent of the Play Store, (like Faircode - NetGuard and FairEmail), that would be wonderful. 

...and...

&gt; I understand the piracy issue, I support something being put in place to make that more difficult but when that something makes life more difficult for legitimate, paying customers like myself, it can go to hell. Life has enough hassles and irritations already, lol

...and...

&gt; I've already been avoiding apps which come in bundles, developers have lost out on over $100 this year so far from me because they've adopted this delivery method, (literally the only thing that stopped me purchasing their software), and that's just going to grow because as I have been doing so already, I'll simply look elsewhere, (in those particular instances it was a mixture of paid apps from other developers which didn't have any Play Store dependencies and foss software). 

...and...

&gt; Also, historically, restricting what people can do with things they've paid money for hasn't exactly been the best move from an anti-piracy perspective as the movie, music and gaming industries especially are constantly telling the world and his dog via media outlets and the court systems of the world.

1) Piracy is your third choice of getting an app if the 2 other ways are not available. That's basically my whole point and there is no need to read the rest to understand we will never agree. There is no excuse to put piracy in a list even if you have 1000 of points.

2) Who are you to decide which payement method the developer should use? Do you know the reasons? If the method is not there, sorry for you, find an alternative, don't be like ""Developer has not used my payement method, so I can steal his app""

3) Not integrating Faircode, Netguard of whatever method you refer may make them loose 100 dollars from you, ok, but do you know what they might lose in support, time taken to implement it, delaying other interesting features? Sorry to learn you that, but your own person and your 100 dollars are not equivalent to what the developer can do for the benefit of thousands of users instead of implementing the methods you like. You are not more important than these people

Though yeah, some just remember one.)

I can see where the confusion with regards to ""multipoint pairing"" comes from, though. At some point people started adding ""pairing"" to the term when that's... not what it is. It's a (point-to-)multipoint connection. The official spec doesn't even make special note of it as such, it's just a secondary feature of point-to-multipoint/multi-stream connections (which the SIG primarily touts for sending audio streams to multiple devices, rather than receiving them), where slave devices (e.g. headphones) can listen in on multiple streams simultaneously.

But there are advantages to the Photos library. Such as iCloud sync across all your devices. And there‚Äôs an optimized version of this that limits the photo size if you‚Äôre running out of space on your phone. So, I imagine there is some reasoning on why they chose this method to manage it in a library form. I‚Äôm pretty sure they do things with thumbnails, JPG, and RAW files - all managed to efficiently sync those across devices. 

Like I said, you can still avoid this by manually managing your photos. But you don‚Äôt get the nice photo experience that I‚Äôm sure the majority of users care about. 

It‚Äôs similar to how they have a Notes app that doesn‚Äôt have normal text files. But rather, it‚Äôs a synchronized list of notes across all your devices that you can share with others.

h3fgh6r,Pharrels,0,19,I bet they dropped the S-naming with iPhones. Why wasn't the iPhone 12 named 11S? Bigger and better numbers on the phone makes consumers think you're getting an real upgrade over the previous one.,0

h3fjs51,Relay_Slide,0,1,"The port isn‚Äôt only used for charging though. That‚Äôs the problem. Unless MagSafe becomes more than literally just some magnets imbedded in your device, you need a port for debugging devices, updating older devices, backing up to a Mac without iCloud, etc. 

If your phone won‚Äôt power up, you connect it to a computer with a cable to diagnose the problem. You can‚Äôt do that with MagSafe.

Then there‚Äôs also the issue of data transfer speeds. Macs and iPads use USB-C to transfer files at high speed. Lightening is very outdated in this regard, with speeds under USB 3.0.

With Face ID you need to be looking squarely at the phone so you have to pick it up and stare at it. Makes it far less quick and casual. I like it when my technology allows me to be quick and casual with my phone.",0

I‚Äôve been buying phones so much I‚Äôve gotten used to always having a monthly phone payment, just like a mortgage or car payment.

Well for one, Windows has been around a lot longer than Android, and for two, isn't that what drivers are for? Also computers and operating systems are designed with modularity and parts interchangeability in mind, which is not the case for smartphones.

If you open your password manager and then look away to start typing the password into your desktop, suddenly it's locked. 
* When driving, you can unlock a thumbprint without taking your eyes off the road. Not so when you have to lean over and stare at a phone for 2-3 sec. Makes it challenging to navigate with limited battery (as the charging port is acting as an aux port).

We're talking about personal preference, and some seriously first world problems. There are plenty of arguments in favor of FaceID: cold weather or jobs requiring gloves; cases work better with a camera than a fingerprint sensor, etc.",0

h3ay3c7,Sendbeer,0,1,"Might as well say that for everything nowadays. I paid over $1000 for my last phone and Samsung just can't seem to help themselves. 3-4 apps installed by default serve up ads even if you don't use them. They have a Google Play Services equivalent that dishes up ads if you don't disable it. And ocassionally they add one through their own app store (which is an ad infested piece of shit). Supposedly there are options during setup to disable most of them, but each app seems to have its own option to disable them buried in the options somewhere. It would be nice if they just had one place to enable/disable all of them, but of course they don't do that. I pay my cell phone company a bag full of cash every month... They track me. Most do. Kind of hard to find any company that's bigger than your average mom and pop shop that doesn't sell my info or dish up ads while taking my money. I stopped going to movies long before Covid because theaters took around $30 from me and play obnoxiously loud commercials the whole time prior to the movie. I don't even know what the point of going to a movie with a friend is, you can't talk prior to watching. 

Point is, Google isn't unique in this regard. It's kind of sad really. Well maybe I don't have a point, not like I am disputing anything you said. Just triggered a rant I guess.",1

Looking purely at specs vs price, it really is a great deal. 

I'm starting to suspect that new manufacturers go through a phase where they underprice their phones, to gain market share and a good reputation, before they start to bump up the prices.

Irregardless of model, iPhones are always best sellers regardless of screen size.

The SE2 sold extremely well as a budget iPhone, its cost less than half the iPhone 11Pro/Max, and about ~70% of the cost of the 11.

What do you want a mobile OS to do with all that power exactly?

I'm using reddit sync app and when it's prompted to download media for the first time, I had to choose a folder to save.

Maybe telegram would have to do something similar in the future?

So , now that performance projections are made, we can discuss efficiency.

Yeah , no contest mate... Zen4 will very possibly be a big step forward especially if it goes to TSMC 5nm , but Zen2/Zen3 need almost 10W to reach boost frequency on a single core. It really depends on the actual implementation of a potential ARM X2 chip  (e.g. Target frequency and binning) but i doubt single core boost frequency is gonna need more than 5W...

h2yzhog,FOXMETROID,0,2,Seriously! I had one throughout high school and I was hoping for one day they integrated windows and android. Ahh the days of using third party apps like 'Swapchat' because Snapchat was never on the WS.,1

Then, the S21 was actually more expensive than the S20 ($950  v $900 converted) - crazy considering people in the US complain about how it's not worth even after the price cut from last gen. It didn't get a single discount yet, even though S21 is selling as low as $599 in the US.

h2z4zsl,ConspicuousPineapple,1,1,"What I was thinking was more about having a server that registers as some kind of pass-through device itself. It receives all notifications (regardless of their actual target) through a REST route that is given as a callback to the public API. When it needs to send push notifications on its own, it can simply do so through the already-existing routes in the API, no need to have an always-on connection anywhere.

Maybe I'm basing all this on wrong assumptions, but if I'm not it seems like the only missing piece is the ability to register this new kind of device with callback URLs so it can receive notifications.",1

[4800H Zen2           1217 SC ( 1073 Integer , 1352 Floating Point)](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/8547311)  (4.3Ghz?)

At the top of my head , Zen3 5900HX reaches \~1500 Single core score. at 4.6 Ghz.

At [anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16463/snapdragon-888-vs-exynos-2100-galaxy-s21-ultra/4) you can see the power consumption of the ARM X1 chip . \[3W-5.5 W\] As i mentioned before Zen2-Zen3 consumes \~ 9W single core at 4GHz which isn't even max Turbo.

So yeah , i totally believe an ARM X2 chip (+15% IPC over X1) at 3.2 Ghz (+10% over phone frequency) and with a more beefy laptop memory controller will be competitive with Zen3 and Tigerlake at single core native code. Not necessarily beating it but hey... Comparable performance at almost half wattage.

Zen4 is leaked to have 2 configurations on laptops 1. the same as desktop chiplet with RDNA2 35W+ . 2 Exclusive mobile / Laptop die &lt;35W... The mobile part i expect to be a greatly efficient chip all things considered... I expect it to launch Q1 2023... The higher power config same as desktops maybe Q4 2022...

We'll wait to see what's what next year. I know i'm excited... And that's without considering Qualcomm(+Nuvia acquisition) plans on laptop chips.

h2v1s21,HelpfulCherry,0,-2,"Battery life and sound quality are going to be size-limited. So without making them bigger, you're unlikely to see much improvement to either. What really helps battery life is just... more battery, and what really helps sound quality is distance from the drivers to your ear canals *and* the overall size of the driver. Airpods are pretty bad in both of those respects, because they sit right in your ear canal and have tiny drivers. It's why stuff like even cheap over-ears blow them out of the water.

Though if Apple did manage to work some kind of magic and make the Airpods sound ""bigger"" while still retaining the earbud form factor, I'd be pretty fuckin amazed and certainly sold on a pair.

As far as repairability goes... well, this is Apple we're talking about. And certainly there's going to be some concessions made on that front when packing what is already a lot of stuff into a very small thing. I can't imagine other ""high-end"" earbuds are much better in that regard.",0

I generally don't put a lot of weight into the audio quality performance of earbuds because they're basically antithetical to good audio. Even cheap over-ears will tend to blow them out of the water as you'll get a much bigger sound.

Where I feel like the airpods really *win* though, is the pocketability. Being able to quickly whip them out, pop one or both in and have my music all to myself is nice. Even nicer with what is frankly excellent ANC. But critical-listening headphones they are not, nor will they ever be unless Apple makes some really big strides in the tech.

Can‚Äôt count how many times I got my sd card corrupted by plugging it to other computers before.

And this is rarely talked about but if you know how to do it right, which I learned thru the years, file management in iOS is easy. Like you don‚Äôt even need cables. I mean it is not as spoonfeeding like the plug and transfer in Android but once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs not as much a pain in the ass as some make it out to be.

Plus, if I want better file management and customization I WOULD get an android.

* Do you have some sorta of scanning system, like using NFC? Because then you have to get the government to have compatible devices and have them equipped/installed everywhere they need to be used.

* If your phone/device dies, what then? If your driver's license is on your phone, are you just not allowed to drive while the phone is dead?

&gt; Hey, sorry just saw this post. We have unpublished our iOS app.

&gt;The root issue is that Apple now requires ""Sign in with Apple"" for any app that offers Google / Facebook sign in. We have no interest in adding yet another sign in option everywhere, which is a lot of work, just to make Apple happy.

&gt;Instead, we'd love to just leave our iOS app alone for the time being, however Facebook has gotten angry we haven't updated our Facebook Login SDK on iOS. Thus, they've forced our hand to either go through all the work of updating our app, or instead, simply unpublish.

&gt;For those not aware, fully updating our iOS app for the latest versions of Swift, iOS, etc and then adding Sign in with Apple is a huge amount of work. Sadly iOS is our least popular / used platform. It's also the platform we can to the least interesting things. As a result, we've chosen to unpublish it for the time being to focus on the platforms where we can do more interesting things.






I came to know about this just a few months ago but it happened like a year ago as you see. Since if the app is already installed and set up, it works without any problems so I never anticipated something like this had happened. Though, I think you can still use the service by using safari to use the browser version of pushbullet. I haven't tried that since my app still works.",1

The difference between 20 minutes and this is, it took a few months for this to be developed, who reverse engineered Google's implementation, and has been talking to one of the developers of the Google version. And you're ignoring the decision making time for which way to take the design, this is not worrying about that part of the implementation at all.

Software updates are a major reason to get this phone over the OG Nord. OnePlus's updates become noticeably worse after a year. This one also has a slightly larger battery and a headphone jack if that's important. 

That being said, I'd recommend the A52 5G over either of them if one is willing to pay the extra since it is a superior device imo. I'd personally stay away from the Redmi Note 10 Pro, the Poco X3 Pro and the Poco F3 as I can't stand MIUI.",1

&gt;Again with the graphics as a determination of what defines a game.

I haven't claimed *anything* in particular ""defines"" a game. Nor did I specify any particular area of performance in the indicated quote. There are games that have performance settings unrelated to graphics, after all. Now that you mention it, though, it should be easy to comprehend that video is a significant factor in...well... *video* games. If you're unhappy with the paradigm of our discussion, just remember that you set it with the list of games you provided. Some of the games I count among my library are text based.

&gt;I don‚Äôt think you understand what ‚ÄúAAA titles‚Äù means. There are AAA titles on OSX, iOS

I haven't claimed that there aren't any AAA titles on Apple products. Nor have I said anything from which that could reasonably be inferred. All I said was that I can take the ability to run them for granted now and for the next several years. 

&gt;I mention the Nintendo switch because if we follow your logic then it is a console that can never have real games because they are not PC games.

I haven't said anything that could reasonably be interpreted as ""non PC games aren't real games"". Nor have I said anything from which that could reasonably be inferred.

&gt;‚Ä¶ over 900 games? I have over 10,000 :) All playable.

I have emulator collections too. It didn't even occur to me to count every game in them individually because that seemed disingenuous regarding the point being made, but rest assured that I, too, can play the Sega Genesis version of Phantasy Star should the desire ever take me. I also didn't count all my old C64 and Amiga stuff, nor the freeware game collection CDs--some of which contain thousands of titles. I also by considered choice did not include the many free Android games that run just fine on PC because trivial as they are to acquire, I'd never bother with them.

Instead, I only counted the purchasable and/or individually licensable titles that fit with the list that YOU provided, quoted here as a reminder:

h2mkz1u,i-like-to-be-wooshed,0,1,"#from the article:


When the iPhone 12 mini first launched last year, it was hailed as the ‚Äòbest compact phone‚Äô and ‚Äòthe compact iPhone you‚Äôve been wanting for years, among many other names. However, it didn‚Äôt translate to the sales numbers Apple was expecting. It seems like the company isn‚Äôt pleased about it as the tech giant has reportedly ended the production of the iPhone 12 mini.


The first mini flagship in years gave people a breath of fresh air in a world of huge smartphones, but it looks like not many were happy about the screen size, or maybe it was the underwhelming battery life. Whatever the reason might be for low sales numbers, according to TrendForce, the iPhone 12 mini ‚Äúreached End-of-Life ahead of time‚Äù during the second quarter of 2021. Hence, it suggests that Apple will shift focus to selling through its existing inventory of the device without producing any further units.


Back in January, it was reported that Apple was cutting down on iPhone 12 Mini orders and was giving a boost to iPhone 12 Pro production due to higher demand for the latter. The iPhone 12 mini was launched in October 2020. It features a 5.4-inch display that was targeted toward the niche audience of smaller smartphones. It started at USD 699.


However, the smartphone was plagued by average battery life. Hence, it might not have brought in the profit Apple was expecting. That being said, the iPhone 12 mini accounted for more profit than Samsung did with the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Plus.


Apple is expected to launch four iPhones next year as well. However, the company could announce high-end 6.7-inch and 6.1-inch variants of iPhone 14 alongside the lower-end 6.7-inch and 6.1-inch models. We could still get an iPhone 13 mini this year.",0

h2mlmr5,irn-stu,0,1,"You are maybe right.  I do know that my wife and I want a mini as our next phones, the question is, will there be that option?  For me, it isn't the size of the phone, it's the size of the screen.  Phones got bigger to have bigger screens, then the bezels got reduced and the screens took over that space.  I like the mini because the phone *shrunk* when the bezels went.  Compared to the SE which is almost the same physical size, the mini has 20% more screen to body ratio.  *That's* what I'm after.

Maybe this doesn't mean the end of the mini, maybe they just feel there is enough supply out there for the demand.  

As another user mentioned, the SE covered the small *and* cheap option for users that want both or either of those options.

This is all just more anecdotal stuff, Apple gonna do what Apple gonna do.",0

Who else would have more political capital then Apple really‚Ä¶ no one else operates at their scale and has their influence also. 

Frankly I‚Äôm not paid to sort it out for them, but here‚Äôs some ideas: 

-	If they wanna continue business there without doing anything meaningful to help marginalised groups, then *stop* using said groups issues issues as advertising for themselves. Easy way out, little money lost. 
-	Threaten to pull out sales/manufacturing/support from countries that don‚Äôt support basic human rights and see what happens, tell everyone why. 
-	Impose higher prices on products/services there, explain to all customers in that country why. 
-	Reduce reliance on parts/manufacturing from any one country so they aren‚Äôt beholden to them (this has been improving to be fair)
-	Or the opposite way: if they wanna use Pride to further their brand then keep in the spirit of protests that started it. Throw messages and information onto people‚Äôs devices in these countries, stir some shit up, piss some people off, but teach a bunch in the process and show their support (if it‚Äôs really there). Add some sneaky software tricks to allow customers to skirt around country-level content blocks and bans. Would a country fine them for it? Ban them? Let‚Äôs find out. 

I‚Äôm not saying any of these are great solutions. I‚Äôm saying Apple‚Äôs current ones aren‚Äôt good enough and they could do better.",0

h2msw26,Lillumultipass99,0,1,"Hi everyone, 

  
I had bought the Apple silicon red case which, although very nice, is a bit too bulky to my taste. 

  
Then I got a KDL plastic one : it was very thin but my phone fell on the very first day I got it and the case got broken. Finally, I tried a spigen thin case : it is nice and rather thin but it really lowers the magnetism of the iphone and my Apple wallet barely sticks anymore.

Sure they mostly sell ads and that's what makes money. However the apps, the products, the ecosystem as a whole drives users to the ad funnel. They are starting to loose the top of the ad funnel.

Yes Google also has its cloud services and cloud compute offerings, but the product ecosystem is what fuels all of this at the scale it is at. Those services need the scale.",1

That takes a lot of time and effort for the readers though and many will not go through that exercise. The format I'm describing works for most people wanting a quick comprehensive comparison. 

Are you saying it negates the effect of larger sensors that might have more megapixels? Generally resizing more megapixels will give you a sharper image so I disagree that the larger sensor's advantage is lost. If it has more dynamic range, richer colors, all that stuff should be preserved. I'm not saying to normalize/resize it to some small size. It should be probably the size of the smallest resolution. For phones I'd imagine resizing everything down to 12 or 16mp should be fine and far larger than what 99% of cell phone imagery is consumed at.",1

h2mmnqu,ZenDendou,0,1,"Yeah, so perfect that even a toddler can literally use it.

However, Google Calendar had a better widget than Apple did. I'm practically using a 3rd party widget on an iPhone, which is just my 2nd line for work and all it does is take appointment, call, and text.

The only thing good about Apple is just how it all ties in, the only bad thing is many apple users will claim apple did it first or did it better.

The only thing that started this whole thing was Widget on Windows Vista, which eventually got removed, then there was Rainlender, which allowed you to tweak the UI on your windows to even mimic Jarvis in Iron Man.

Also, the only reasons why Apple's ""Find My iPhone"" is better is simply because Apple invested not only in it, but there already a large iPhone users out there, and if I remember, Apple basically ping off another phone instead of a wifi or BT.",1

h2igho3,symbiote_of_doom,0,2,"&gt;Apple‚Äôs privacy stance

I have Apple products like iPads and a family that uses only iPhones.

But, this is something I find a bit ridiculous to believe.

I like that Apple is adding more privacy conscious features like tracking an app's internet traffic activity among other things in iOS 15.

But, it's like they're selling privacy from everyone but Apple.

I say this because if you look closely, they're still not giving the ***option*** of full E2EE cloud backups and sync.

AFAIK, for example, Safari bookmarks aren't E2EE. 

The amount of E2EE data is too limited for a company that is as big as 4 big companies: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303)

This is what I find hypocritical.

And, I'm supposed to praise them for adding privacy features to a closed-system that they control.

I'll commend their business model here but that's about it.

And fuck Facebook, but, why are Apple's personalized ads not opt-in? And, why the fuck were people listening in on Siri's convos?",0

ATM I have a Huawei p30,so an average  phone. I decided to wait for the new Pro as it should get a good amount of new upgrades (120hz, a less invasive notch, maybe maybe the return of the Touch id). 

If you think that is impossible to use your crap phone for another 3 months , go for it and get the mini. I don't think it will get so many upgrades like the other iPhone models. If you are unhappy you can always return it or resell it when the new 13 mini comes out.

Haha, I should be the one thanking you for such amazing work.

&gt;* the fact that [the audio capture API lets apps decide whether they can be captured](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy#apps-restrictions) does not motivate me a lot: in practice, many apps are just not captured, and users don't understand why

Doesn't this happen with the screen capture API as well? I honestly never tried but I'm assuming that if I tried to scrcpy the netflix app, for example, it would just show me a blank screen. Or is it more restrictive?

&gt;To bypass these limitations, some vendors even add private audio sources (requiring system permissions) to be able to capture audio from all apps for their own recording application (but inaccessible from a non-system app): [https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy/issues/113](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy/issues/113)

No, it really doesn't. Most workloads don't benefit from vectorization... and it also depends on how the extensions are implemented. The early ARM extensions, NEON, were pretty much worthless and maybe only benefited the marketing department.

This does not affect the amount of compression that will be applied to a picture in your messaging app of choice. If you're using WhatsApp, it'll be different, if you're using Signal, it'll be different, if you're using RCS or iMessage, it'll be different.

However, all of the above are viewable. SMS is the one that makes images look like dogshit and using heic or jpeg won't make a difference to that.",1

That's a weird thing to say. Like yes, theoretically they could. They could also probably completely brick your phone, or make it uninstall all your apps, or send ads right to your phone (like Samsung does sometimes). All those things are technically possible, but that mean they'd do it.

It's also like saying, technically you don't own the game on Steam and Valve could shut down tomorrow taking away all your games. All these hypotheticals are true, but maybe not realistic. They may or may not have crossed a line here, but you're taking the slippery slope argument too far I think.",1

h2es5x8,Perunov,0,1,"This is like Microsoft silently installing ""Weather and News"" app on desktop with new update and upsetting users, but worse.

Yes, Google can break things, like pushing bad web-view component. And yes, they can theoretically kill off everything as well. But I'm talking about a very specific sequence related to privacy that we've just went through.

Notification of exposure switched from ""hey, this is completely opt-in, nothing will track you, trust us, this is just an API, you have to opt-in AND install an app from your health authority if you ever decide to participate"" to ""oh, we've silently installed an app on your phone, but you should still totally trust us, it's opt-in"".

Previously that extra step was, basically, another confirmation that yes, you do indeed want to opt in into exposure notification. You enable API, you install an app, then it works.

And now double-opt-in silently got eliminated and an app got installed (including for people who don't live in MA, I'm sure that will be labeled as ""a mistake"")

So yeah, I think it's logical to presume that later we might quietly get ""everyone is now opted in into API, for the greater good!"".",1

h26quhu,SirB0ing,0,9,"Phone Repair Tech here.

I've met over 2,000 people between 2019-2021 and dealt with slightly more iPhone users. Direct contact with the end users.

When it comes to tech literacy I've experienced a larger spectrum of knowledge with iPhone users than with Android users. Many android users I've met keep their phone mostly stock from the manufacturer, a handful go full board and root.

The simplest of requests I've made to iPhone users (finding things in their settings, or asking them for their Apple ID information for calibration reasons) they couldn't even find their IMEI number or know how to disable (or enable) certain features that can also be searched (but you have to pull down when you open settings to get said search bar; which many people don't know about).

When it came to privacy and lack of how certain repairs go, they all tend to ask similar questions. iPhone users tended to be more anal about things even though it's supposedly the safer and more privacy-minded piece of tech. Granted, Apple does keep a lot of things locked down well but that can be a downfall in this particular field and it has made it to where a repair was not viable (not only because it was protocol, but because apple made it that way so you have to jump through said hoops to do it correctly). 

For some reason, iPhone users were more concerned about losing data such as pictures or work files; while android users were more concerned if there were other internal damages caused. 

The biggest thing iPhone users brought up the most was the ecosystem, and how simplistic the OS was, which makes sense. It basically hasn't changed. At least at it's core. 

I find it fascinating that people think if they were to switch OS somehow it would be like alien technology even though apps don't change; they all work basically the same, the icons are the same, they hold the same data. 

I don't believe there's one phone that's better than the others, there's way too many needs, specs, manufacturers, and ways people use their devices. 

For someone who likes to root, customize their phone, don't mind the shorter OS update support and like to be able to buy from LG, Moto, Samsung, Oppo, OnePlus there's one clear option. 

For someone who maybe has other family members (usually younger) who they wanna facetime with, or if they will need help with how their phone works and their kid/grandkid owns an iPhone the likelihood of that person getting an iPhone is basically 100%. That's how it worked with my grandma, but the opposite. I didn't get an iPhone until a couple years after I helped her get her first smartphone so she's had an android and couldn't even figure out iOS whatsoever. 

Phones are tools, entertainment devices. The way you need something to work, how you use it, and other factors is how you decide what to buy. Sure, we can look at specs on paper and say that the newest iPhone is better than X android phone by 5% in this way but get's shit on in the other. There's no such thing as an ultimate superior product in this light. 

I could fight all day for Android devices or iPhones. To me, it's what YOU need and desire. They're just like cars, homes, movies and other things we choose in life. 

I would say of those 2,000 people, yes, iPhone users GENERALLY are less tech-savvy because when they're hyped about apple products it's because they're in the ONE ecosystem and know nothing and have no knowledge or experience outside their bubble. They wouldn't be able to figure out how to add music onto their iPhone without Apple Music/iTunes because it's made simple. 

iPhone users are turn-key types of folks. Android users prefer abilities like customization, choice of manufacturer and there's TONS more control over how much you get to spend on a device because you can buy a $100 Samsung phone and be okay with it.",0
h26rgow,TriscuitCracker,1,-3,"True.  But unfortunately Apple in order to stay in business with China and maintain their massive customer base and huge supply chains unable to be sustained by any other country at this point after Xi came to power definitely looked the other way and complied when Xi asked for all data on IPhone users in China to be stored on servers in China and to give them the encryption keys.

h26shva,Kimantha_Allerdings,0,5,"I agree with Tim Apple that part of the reason for the iPhone's security is the lack of sideloading - including the fact that the mere ability to sideload being baked-in would make people more willing to actually write malware for ios. But I also think that they shot themselves in the foot by making the App Store as much of a cash-grab as it was. It's only now that they're being taken to task for it that they're starting to bend, and I think it will all just be seen as a token gesture.

In other words, this law would make the phone less secure, but I think that Apple is as much to blame as the EU.",0

The push from Apple regarding privacy in iOS 14.5 and Samsung's bullshit convinced me to at least try out an iPhone. I checked with my carrier that I'd have 14 days to return it.

Fell in love in three days. Way nicer experience for me. I kinda got over the whole rooting/customizing/tweaking thing on Android a few years ago anyway, so having a phone that works as well out of the box as the iPhone does was nice.

There is nothing you can do with a 12 Pro Max camera that you can't do sufficiently well with a standard ole 12 camera. The difference between them is so slight that it won't matter in a professional capacity. Either your work is image quality critical, in which case you're using a dedicated camera anyway, or it's not critical and you can get by just fine with even a standard ass 12.

Hell, we use phones at my work for tracking the status and serial number information of warranty vehicle repairs. They use Galaxy S8s. Would a 12 Pro Max make any difference in that work? Absolutely not.

The ""Pro"" moniker on iPhones does not mean it is intended for or focused towards professionals. It does not mean it's any more well focused for a professional setting. It's simply a term Apple uses to separate one line of phones from another. Samsung uses ""Ultra"", Apple uses ""Pro"".

I have a Xiaomi and once tried a friend's BeatsX (which i think use Apple's proprietary chip) and the phone did not even see it, which didn't happen with any other Bluetooth headphones. I now have a pair of Samsung Buds+ and am finding out TWS earphones aren't a true replacement for the headphone jack. They sometimes have random Bluetooth drops when I simply put the phone in my pocket, and you need to get the Galaxy Wearable app to truly make the best use out of them, updating their firmware, setting up their EQ and so on. There's also a proprietary codec these things can take advantage of that's only available on Samsung.

If theres a national upset about privacy then the companies bend our way but idk how to keep that vibe going. Snowden was a while ago.

But still I'd love if android were owned by a different company. Like one only focused on software/product like apple. Apple cares about privacy because they make their coins differently than goog/fb.

Our only hope really is that google copies what apple does in the name of privacy in Hope's to downplay apple's marketing. So google can say ""hey we do that too""",1

They price it higher, tell you it‚Äôs more special. More ‚ÄúPro‚Äù. More aspirational. Costs them a little more, has a greater margin. 

Apple are masters at the price tier creep so that ‚Äúyou may as well‚Äù go up to the next since you‚Äôre already paying so much. On a plan, well that‚Äôs only another ¬£3/ month. Heck that‚Äôs barely a cup of coffee! You won‚Äôt miss that, but you will always wish you had gotten the fancy one.

I‚Äôm very skeptical about the brightness differences, I‚Äôd really like to see both phones face to face to get a conclusion. I think they are very similar if not the same. 

The extra money is worth it if you‚Äôll use your phone naked to actually feel the steel and matte materials, and if you need a lidar.

h1y93l0,mbrevitas,0,1,"I didn't get the Pro exactly because I didn't think it was worth it, but then again this is in Europe, where the price difference between the 12 and 12 Pro is twice as much as in the US. For 100 euros more I'd have strongly considered it just for the telelens camera (and lidar for autofocus). Aesthetically I have to say I don't really like the Pro better; the blue of my 12 is great in my eyes and I'm not a fan of the shiny steel of the sides of the Pro.",0
h1y98g8,PyroTheManiac42069,0,1,"Question about two factor authentication.

So I have two factor authentication active on my Apple ID meaning when I sign in on iCloud in my browser or iTunes desktop app it asks for a code.

That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but I‚Äôm going to be getting a new phone soon and I‚Äôm wondering when I do that is it going to ask for two factor when I sign in on my new phone?",0
h1y9bt8,user34785,0,-6,"Nope. Both the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro have 2,815 mAh while the 12 mini has 2,227 mAh and 12 pro max with 3,687 mAh battery size",0
h1y9cu5,tacosdiscontent,0,17,"Exactly this, I still very hesitant to upgrade my XS to 12 or 13 when it comes out, as I am quite used to having telephoto camera and up until now I never found a personal use-case for ultra wide (maybe I would when I actually got one). 

I guess I could just buy the pro model, but the price difference in non US countries between base model of 12 and 12 pro is \~330‚Ç¨ or \~270‚Ç¨ for 128GB models, which is quite a lot",0
h1y9ift,Dave8889,0,1,"Actually, I just looked up a comparison YouTube video for the SE 2 (black) and 8 (space grey). It looked like there was no silver ring on the 8 in that video (looks like you were onto something there).",0
h1y9msb,mbrevitas,0,13,"I'd say that the 12 Pro is pretty close to being a ""professional"" version of the 12, precisely because the specs of the 12 are so close to it. If you're not a professional/prosumer, you probably don't have much use for the lidar sensor and RAW shooting. The zoom camera also makes sense for photography professionals and enthusiasts; for everyone else it's nice to have, but less of an improvement over cropping. 

The 11 Pro was the one where ""Pro"" didn't mean ""for professionals/enthusiasts"" but rather ""I'm not buying a high-end smartphone with an LCD display in the year of our Lord 2020"".",0

I don't know if 5G is something i really need, even in the next 2-3 years. What i really need is something with a good battery and a decent camera. (at least with a camera which is not warping everything like the iphone se's camera does)

i searched some reviews but all reviewers were only taking pictures who would look bad on all phones.. just bad photgraphers in general so i don't want to judge the camera on their performance. should i just blind-buy the Pixel 4A (Not 5G) or wait for the Nord CE to be available again? there seems to be no way to test the nord ce in local stores here at the moment.",1

h1tn823,UnclePadda,0,2,"The iPhone 3GS was my first smartphone back in 2009, and since then I only had two Android phones: Samsung Galaxy S6 for about a year and a half and the Galaxy S8 for about six months. Those were not bad phones at the time, and I enjoyed having a little more freedom. The slow updates didn't really bother me to be honest. 

But the reason I can't see myself abandoning the iPhone now is obviously the ecosystem that they keep perfecting every year. Airdrop, opening something on my MacBook and continue working on it on my phone. That's awesome. And iOS now has widgets, a files manager and other features previously exclusive to Android. It's still weird why you can't download any file you want, like an MP3 file and play it in the Music app, but apart from that they're doing a great job with iOS. Besides, most 3rd party apps seem to be more optimized for iOS, the best example being Instagram. 

Nowadays however I have an iPhone as my main device, but I've also got myself a Huawei P40 Pro as a kind of toy/secondary phone. I use it for modded apps like YouTube Vanced and gaming mostly, as well as for zoom photos. But do I really need it? Absolutely not.",0

The CPUs they put in their phones don‚Äôt come close to stacking up to an iPhone. And blaming google for the tablets being no good is not fair.

It really is the best phone OS imo, android users can‚Äôt disagree here because I‚Äôve seen numerous android users download these apps that give their android a control center, iPhone icons etc to make it look like iOS

If I had to list more, it would be the sense of security and privacy you get with Apple which might not be anything special for some people but it‚Äôs crucial in my line of work

 Next up would be the camera, doesn‚Äôt matter how good an android camera is it will always look shitty through social media apps

I‚Äôve owned androids and iPhones at the same time in the past and the only thing I ever liked about android was the fact that you could downloaded modded APK‚Äôs for apps/games, and I think that‚Äôs a fair trade to give up that ability in exchange for higher security and privacy we get with iPhones",0

h1tuju2,DimaPronna,0,1,Favorite accessory is definitely the Mag Duo. It looks great and I need a replacement for my old 5W charger. I also love the Tough Armor Mag. It looks super clean!,0
h1tunhn,Woople74,0,2,I like the design and extended software support,0
h1tuoh7,Mabiana,0,2,"Better app optimisation on Iphone is obvious the more you use it ( long time android user), it feels nice to see things just going smooth on all apps. Was bored of large phone but wanted top flagship experience so 12 mini was a no brainer. Apple pay saved me a lot of time , much more common in my place. Finally : support. If let‚Äôs say : Samsung could match apple in terms of software support, it would be 50/50 or just a choice of hardware since both OS has up and downs. Until then I‚Äôm happy with the Iphone, I could go back to android, wouldn‚Äôt bother me at all, but I have no big reason to",0

h1tvdgh,TheJordy,0,1,Definitely the wallet. My current wallet is falling apart with all the leather being worn to bits. I feel its a waste spend a lot of money on a new 'normal' wallet because i barely use anything except a few cards. This would be perfect to replace mine!,0

h1tm649,SponTen,0,2,"&gt; iOS notifications are objectively, across all metrics, worse than on Android.

I used to think this, but I disagree now. Don't get me wrong, Android's notification system is still much better overall, but iOS has:

* Single tap notification from lock screen to open
* Better popup support, when you swipe down banners

Otherwise though, the lack of notification ""favicons"" (can't remember the name of the mini app icons that appear in the notification bar) on iOS is so frustrating and causes me to miss notifications way too often. Not to mention things like notification grouping, interaction with AOD, better sound customisation, etc, that Android has over iOS.",1

h1tmxaq,brunothealmighty,0,7,"His argument is essentially that you're basically using your phone as if it has already degraded by limiting yourself. As in you're not allowing yourself to use the full 100%, just so that in 2-3 years you'll have 95% battery health instead of 80-85%. Basically, the idea is that you should just enjoy the couple years of 95-100% battery health and maybe just consider replacing the battery if you plan on keeping the phone more than 3 years.",1

Cuz I switched from Iphone to the Note 9 2 and a half years ago but the one thing I still can't get used to is the notification system. I felt like IOS notifs were always more instant(?) and clear with the colours and everything compared to Samsung's black/white look. I've been using the ""Power Slide"" app that adds colour to the notifs but it's kinda glitchy and I'm really debating a switch back to IOS just for the instant push notifs alone.",1

Yes. There is no emphasis on the collective; at least, no more than there would be in the US, Britain, or any other major nation for that matter.

You have the events last year a bit reversed.

Mr. Frumusanu (who writes for, and who you call Anandtech)  stated *""40W degrades to 70% capacity in the same cycles 15W would to 90%""*. That may be certainly true but we don't know what that number of Cycles is.

It was after he made said statement that [Oppo released testing figures](https://soyacincau.com/2020/05/14/oppo-responds-to-fast-charging-battery-degradation-allegations/) including would have reported to be independent testing figures from T√úV Rheinland for 40W charging.

Now, Oppo could have been lying about their figures, and Xiaomi might currently be lying about their figures, which is what Mr. Frumusanu believes . But both of those companies aren't pulling slights of hand - They're explicitly stating a certain percentage of battery capacity found to be remaining after a certain number of charging and discharging cycles at a certain maximum wattage.

h1hsq4h,Scratch137,1,1,"&gt;So when she thinks she's lowering the RINGER volume, she's actually lowering the APP volume or something.

You can tell whether you're setting system volume or ringer volume by the appearance of the volume popup.

Ringer volume appears from the top and says ""Ringer,"" while system volume appears from the side and has an icon at the bottom.

How low does she set her ringer? The alarm volume depends on the ringer volume, so if she's been turning her ringer down, she won't be able to hear her alarms.",0

h1hx5xc,Kav19,1,14,one charges $500+ for back glass replacement. one can be done with $20. i think that ifixit rates the iphone higher since it‚Äôs screen can pop off quicker than the galaxy and because they use pull tabs on their batteries. the amount of things you need to take out just to get to the lightning port on iphones is crazy.,0

h1hzt2g,BigBrownHole36,0,378,"In Ireland, it‚Äôs almost a 50-50 split. I say almost, because I see iPhones slightly more frequently than Androids. Most people with iPhones have older phones, so people here like them for their reliability and their longevity. Though there are people who use older Android devices - my friend still has his Samsung Galaxy S6. But iPhones have higher resale value, and a lot of people like to buy them refurbished.

Another thing to consider is that in Ireland, you have access to nearly all of Apple's services. When Apple releases a service, Ireland can expect to get it within a year. Some of Google's services are still not available here, including Google Play TV, and they took years to roll out gift cards here after they were released in America.

Android totally dominates iPhone in total units. The fact is, *most* Android models sold are shitty free-with-contract units that are no good. If you only look at flagships, yes iPhone dominates, but Android is all about quantity over quality and iPhone is the exact opposite.

I'm not shitting on Android here. A good Android phone in 2021 is a worthwhile contender to the top iPhone from about 2-3 years ago, and that's just down to Apple using better components. The fact is, most Android phones sold are not good Android phones. And when people look at spending iPhone money (or more) on a good Android phone, some of them realize the iPhone is way better.

If Android flashships stayed around $500-600, they'd be more competitive, but literally no one in Android needs them to be. Google wins no matter what Android phone you use; they still get their data. They also get their data if you use their apps on iPhone, as many of us do. Samsung wins whether you spring for the top Note or the most basic J-series (I think that's the value line). Because you're still buying Samsung, and I'd argue the value line has a higher profit margin for them. Your carrier wins as long as you aren't buying iPhone, because they can put sponsored apps on it and make more money that way.",0

h1i8wdi,Redcarborundum,0,8,"Today new iPhones are designed as such that even if you take an original battery from another iphone to replace the battery in your iphone, iOS will act as if it‚Äôs NOT an original iPhone battery. You actually need a tool to reprogram it so the phone believes it has a valid battery. Even if you know how to change your own battery, you can‚Äôt do it without the specialized tool.

Right to repair means you can fix your own stuff without manufacturers restricting it and threatening to void your warranty. It already applies to cars, which is why you can repair your new car anywhere, not limited to authorized dealers.",0
h1i9yg7,McSupergeil,0,37,"As someone whos buddy worked in a phone shop i always got to change my phone every year even 6 months cyclus for dirt cheap..

It started with the Samsung Galaxy S1 years and i had probably over 30/40 phones by now...

90% of the time always androids..
Once i changed from a i believe Htc one to iphone 6 i dont wuite know the order anymore and then a year later to the new galaxy and now to the iPhone 12 from a huawei..

And to be honest... i dont think of changing back.. 
androids biggest fault for me the inconsistency it may be its strong suit depending on which  manufacturer you choose but when samsung does something that google doesn't support yet than its a useless feature with a  smaller userbase and unrefined..

Since i had my iphone again ios changed so much  since the iphone 6s era...

Its the simple things like password share on wifi or inter gadget connection between idevices  and smoothed out integration of features that i love... 
why change back to a unrefined and always changing OS that even google itself wont support more than 3years...

h1ic1l3,Sensitive_Amount_512,0,2,"Iphone 11 or 12 ?   


I'm upgrading from a 6s and want the best value for my money. I'm a heavy user so I'd like a bigger battery than the one I currently have, but the pros and maxes are a bit of an overkill for me.

I like the size and design of the 12 , but I'm not interested in 5G, the slightly faster processor, camera etc., so I don't know if the extra 200 bucks is worth it. From what I heard, the 12 still can't properly use the5G efficiently without draining itself, so waiting to use 5G in the future with 12 is out.

The thing about the 11 - I don't know if it will 'keep up' with the newer models as a 2 year old phone. I plan to use this for another 4 years. 

I expect the 13 to be an upgraded 12, I don't know if I should buy the 11 now or it'll be pull from the stores. Do you think the 11 would be good for another 3-4 years ? Should I just buy the 12?",0

h1ic3qv,I800C0LLECT,0,32,"I just switched from pixel 4 XL to iPhone 12. As far as I'm concerned as long as you stay within the routines that Apple placates everything is great. Once you want to do something that is off the beaten path it's a little difficult to use. It's not a big deal.

I honestly believe the pixel experience is very similar to the Apple experience. I'm not impressed but I'm not disappointed.

Watching my daughter helps me understand why so many enjoy Apple. She's isn't tech savvy at all. She can't understand why I might do the things I do with my iPhone. Her phone exists for media consumption and social apps. I use my phone for work, personal business, education, and communicating globally. iPhone doesn't seem to take much effort to work the way you want.

In that way, I think it's just more of an appliance for most Apple users. On Android, flagship devices tend to be more of an adventure for tech enthusiasts.",0

However, after years and years, that ecosystem still doesn‚Äôt exist, the prices of their phones shot straight up, and Google slowly takes more customization options away. As much as Samsung claims to differentiate itself from Apple, their phones, and the Android OS as well, are slowly becoming more and more like iPhones.

h1hro2b,Kataps25,0,1,"Well at leasst it seems there are definitely a few persons who prefer Samsung's software on this subreddit. It's hard to say if the general population would find stock Android unappealing because many people probably don't know it. Were more people to know it, some would like it and some would hate it because it doesn't have features they took for granted, we  don't have general numbers on that.

Though, in all seriousness, and even if I like to repeat this like many others hear, saying it ""doesn't sell"" is a bit of an exageration. Nothing really runs stock so it's a vague idea by itself, stock-like is probably a better term even though rather vague too. As far as stock-like goes, I heard about Motorola being successful in Brazil for example, though I don't know how much of a role their clean UI played and if they still sell well there. And Google's Pixel line seems to get more and more attention at least in the USA, for what it's worth.",1

Should I trade performance for OneUI?

I'm wondering if the 750g won't lag in a year or 2.",1
h1hry4g,wittyusername903,0,4,"Couldn't agree more. I like the new design a lot in terms of shapes and spacing and such, but I'm really not big on automatic color extraction. I've played around with that a lot in the context of widgets and KLWP, and in my experience it was usually a 50/50 chance of the colors looking shitty. Even worse when trying to use a picture of your loved ones or pets as a wallpaper, that's even more likely to end up with everything being some weird light brown. 

Plus, I think another problem is when the auto-extracted colors make their way into non-system UIs, like apps where the devs have chosen their own color scheme. In the other thread someone posted [this](https://i.imgur.com/wZgQBUT.jpeg) screenshot, which is a great example of the terrible color clashes you end up getting.",1

Doesn't really excuse the behaviour, it just reiterates my point of money over morals for a company that pretends morality is one of their cornerstones",0
h1dvib5,junicks,0,5,It‚Äôs pretty easy to have the moral high ground when not having to deal with the consequences. Guys like you are ironically always the first in line for each given regime.,0

What blind, uneducated generalisation are you applying here?",0
h1dyey3,PhilsterM9,0,3,How are you using more than 1 app at a time,0
h1dymy3,junicks,0,6,"okay, let's start over. the initial scenario is, that apple can't roll out all new privacy oriented features in certain regions, known for their hostility upon such features and services. like, google has to censor it's results in china, proton-services aren't working properly in saudi-arabia, and so on.

now, you say apple should roll them out anyways in said regions to make a moral stand against censorship, lack of privacy and so on. that would only result in apple getting warned, fined and eventually blocked from offering their services there. one can argue that's the right path to go, others will say that people will lose access to all apple related services then and apple itself won't lose the market. in the end, they are just complying with local law.

you actually are first in line right now, defending the western mainstream opinion on the matter and don't get me wrong, i'm a heavy supporter of online privacy, i'm using protonmail/vpn, threema, ddg, linux and so on - apples current engagement in user privacy even made me switch back to ios after not having a iphone since the 3GS days.

the difference between us here is, that i understand why apple acts the way they do and that it is in the end the best option for the company AND their customers in these regions. if apple's services and maybe even their hardware would get banned there, people would lose the last shred of privacy and data protection they still have left and would be forced to switch to inferior, most likely state controlled alternatives. it would be a battle apple could not win.

your comparison with boss and vw is actually a pretty stupid one since boss was a regular company doing a state job like everywhere on the planet (it's pretty easy to judge behaviour in hindsight and even more when one has no idea what he is talking about) and vw was even founded in 1937 because hitler wanted to build cars for the masses, so, get your facts straight next time.

h1dz8p0,i-like-to-be-wooshed,0,62,"Nashville Chatter Class has discovered a new Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) database pointing towards several unreleased iPhone 13 models that Apple will be launching in the fall.

EEC Apple iphone 13
Versions of iPhone running iOS 14 are listed with the model numbers A2628, A2630, A2634, A2635, A2640, A2643, and A2645. None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.

The EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.

Apple's 2021 ‚ÄåiPhone 13‚Äå lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end ""Pro"" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.

Major design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch. See our dedicated iPhone 13 roundup for all the details.",0
h1dzdzd,junicks,0,3,"china has a different set of moral views than the western world and that's pretty much the bottom line here. you want apple to force western moral views on them despite people there not caring about it. i don't chose ""money"", i respect different cultures and accept different politically systems, if i like them or not. and so does every company who want's to sell their products in china. apple is a multi billion tech giant, not a ngo. people tend to forget that.",0

Yes, for companies, but we are human beings.

Excusing your lack of empathy with ""well corporations don't care about human rights so why should I?"" is just a miserable justification and is what allows these things to continue happening.

You disputing the fact that Apple don't care about morals or ethics seems a bit strange, considering your immediate follow up was to try and justify them not having morals or ethics.",0
h1e13yy,junicks,0,1,"i have no idea why it is so hard to understand that apple cares about user privacy in regions they can do something about it when there are competitors that don't and are even hostile about them. apple can't do shit about it in places like china, so why pick a fight that will end in crippleing themselves?",0

h1e2ejr,Rogerss93,1,2,"&gt; i have no idea why it is so hard to understand that apple cares about user privacy

You have no idea? that doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

Apple don't care about privacy, they just know privacy is hot right now and as a result, sells.

If Apple cared about privacy, iCloud services would be properly encrypted, as opposed to Apple picking and choosing which iCloud services they protect.

If Apple cared about privacy, they wouldn't have turned over private information from around a dozen HIC members including children to the Trump administration.",0

h1ehnuu,Euphoric-Benefit,0,2,"I'm looking for my first iPhone and accessories on T-Mobile. I'm currently using a Moto G5 Plus.

I'll probably keep the phone for at least 4-5 years (just like this one) so I'm most concerned about future proofing. 

I tried the SE, 11, 12 Mini and 12 in store. The SE and the Mini felt a bit small, especially compared to my current phone's screen. 

I feel like the 12's newer, lighter design and better processor beats the 11, so my first choice is a 128gb iPhone 12.

Q's: 

Is there anything else I should be considering?

Should I wait until the 13 is out before getting a 12? If the prices don't typically drop by a significant amount (10% +), I'd rather buy it now. 


What is a good iPhone case (preferably not too bulky) and screen protector? 


What charger should I buy? (I read they don't come with power bricks anymore) 


Should I get Apple care, and if so, when? 


Will this phone work on a Telcel (Mexican carrier)? 


Thanks!",0

h1eiuer,IgnisRexLeo,0,4,"iPhone 11 Pro vs iPhone 12 Mini

Currently on an iPhone 7 and I want to continue using a phone that‚Äôs relatively compact.

Camera is definitely a top priority (which is why the telephoto on the Pro is enticing). But the 12 Mini has Night Mode on all lenses including the front camera, so that‚Äôs a nice bonus too. 

I do a lot of FaceTiming so battery life is also a big requirement. I‚Äôve heard lots of complaints about the Mini‚Äôs battery life, but how does it compare to the 11 Pro? 

Intending to keep the phone for a long time so performance is important 5-6 years into the phone‚Äôs life. But not sure how significant the difference is between both phone‚Äôs performance. 

Would love any advice, personal experience, etc?",0

h1do8la,LordOfTheMosquitos,0,5,"&gt; websites that still function correctly on a version of Safari from 2016.

Even more frustrating part is that Safari is often 2-3 years later in adding web features, so a version of Safari from 2016 is probably equivalent to a version of Chromium from 2013.

For example, I use iPhone 5 as my main phone (released September 2012). It is on iOS 10 (last updated July 2017). I can't view images on Wikipedia on Safari, unless I click on them. That's because Wikipedia uses IntersectionObserver API, which [Chrome added in May 2016, but Safari only added in March 2019](https://caniuse.com/intersectionobserver).

Apple does this deliberately to hinder web apps, to push them to App Store where they get a 30% cut. They also don't allow any browser that isn't based on Safari on App Store, and they don't allow installing anything that's not from App Store. If they did, I might have been able to install a more modern Chromium-based browser. Hell, even a Chromium-based browser as old as my Safari from 2017 would work fine for the most part.

As for security, sure, old Android phones might have unfixed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi vulnerabilities and such, but those attacks require close-range attackers and are less of a concern compared to browsers (as well as other apps with internet connections), which are open to the World Wide Web. I would prefer taking my chances with an old Android but with an up-to-date browser/apps, compared to my iPhone, security-wise.",1

I'm explaining that Apple are putting money first over ethics and morals, and you're completely missing the point saying ""hurr durr why shouldn't they?""

This is a company that removed a charger to increase profits and used the environment as an excuse

This is a company that opted against including USB-C on their phones in favour of profit, even when governments started to mandate one cable for all phones, Apple still skirted it.

This is a company that is currently involved in more anti-trust suits than I can care to count

This is a company that is building competing ad services under the guise of protecting our privacy


When are you people going to accept that Apple aren't arbiters of morality? they are just as shitty as every other huge corporation, and it's okay to say that.

If apple are going to pretend they are doing things out of the kindness of their heart, and because it's in the interests of a better world, they need to be consistent rather than picking and choosing.

Apple bend to China's will at every opportunity, and people like you are why they get a free pass.",0

Most tutorials are available for it and help is easily accessible making learning quicker.

For these kinds of workloads, iPad becomes a lot more viable. Also drawing on a tablet makes more sense. This leads to most people interested in art to go for iPad and then leads to most apps either designed/optimized for iPad or straight up not available on android.

For example, Illustrator is just available on iPad. Android gets the gimped version with basically no features. For me on a tablet, it's not even a consideration for android tablet even though I prefer android on phones.

h198nav,parental92,0,-8,"like a thing you put a horses in ? no this is a piece of software.  If you look close enough there is a word that indicate the answer or question, the word is **BETA.** 

&amp;#x200B;

in case you don't know what that word means here a wikipedia's definition to help you understand it.

&gt;Beta  
&gt;  
&gt;  
""Beta test"" redirects here. For the film, see Beta Test (film).  
Beta, named after the second letter of the Greek alphabet, is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as betaware.\[6\] A beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.\[7\] Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software and speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can be either public or private, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a preview, preview release, prototype, technical preview or technology preview (TP),\[8\] or early access. Since the introduction of Windows 8, Microsoft has called pre-release software a preview rather than beta. All pre-release builds released through the Windows Insider Program launched in 2014 are termed ""Insider Preview builds"". ""Beta"" may also indicate something more like a release candidate, or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.\[9\]  
  
Beta testers are people who actively report issues of beta software. They are usually customers or representatives of prospective customers of the organization that develops the software. Beta testers tend to volunteer their services free of charge but often receive versions of the product they test, discounts on the release version, or other incentives.",1

Oculus products - which are popular - are 100% Facebook products. The company ""Oculus VR LLC"" was dissolved into Facebook back in September 2018.

I don't know what they did with their market research, but I can't help but feel that the brand direction has been a series of misfires. They never seem to be able to appeal mainstream users.

Regardless, I'm glad that they finally introduced accent colors after all these years, a concept that both macOS and Windows (and notably, Windows Phone) have for quite a long time now. I hope iOS would follow suit.

What I mean is that whenever you go and view a photo/video that is not stored locally, the system will download a sort of ""medium"" quality version of such media, and the only way to have iOS download the real, uncompressed version, is going into edit mode and then canceling the action. (cause you are not actually trying to edit that media, you just want to look at it). That way the full res is downloaded.  

This makes no sense to me and I hate staring at a download screen when I maybe just want to have a quick look at older memories or show something to friends (most noticeable in videos which look all pixeled up even when you download the medium quality version), so I ended up just getting a 512 GB phone and hopefully it will last me years before I need to switch. 256 GB could have lasted just fine but with the full downloaded gallery I'd only have a few GBs left so not really ideal.

h14h68y,InitiallyDecent,0,6,"&gt; I'm sorry, but how do they not have Android Auto/Apple CarPlay on their headunits?

They don't need it. Their own system does what the majority of people would need Android Auto or Apple CarPlay for. They already have google maps built into it, which includes added functionality for showing charging stations and including them if needed in directions. They have their own entertainment options like Spotify, Netflix, Youtube already built in. Other things like Calendar, Phone, etc.. are also all there.

Yes having access to any choice of apps would be nice, but most people are already serviced by what they offer and they continually expand what it does.",1

Personally I am totally excited that my code reacts the user phone.

With one line of code, my notification appears as a bubble, or a classic notification, or any crazy implementation a manufacturer might decide to tweak Android depending on the brand/Android version.

When I explain the customer that its application might vary on device not always according to user overall experience with his phone, everyone is excited (user, developer, manager, customer).

There might be a few exceptions, but i am excited when I see my application reading differently on different brands/version as it works pretty well at the end.

But i understand that's an unpopular opinion",1

h14i603,mfuzzey,0,1,"&gt;My statement still holds true because the mainline-android is not available out of the box and is still being worked on

Sure it's still being worked on. But I still say your statement that ""Android kernel is so far from mainline it's a joke"" is no longer true (it was true a few years back though). Yes it will take time for this to work it's way into devices and we may never see phones running 100% mainline kernels but they will be a lot closer. 500 patches isn't much.


&gt;Also, Linux kernel requires GPL licensed drivers and modules which clearly goes against what SoC annd manufacturers provide. 

Actually the big name vendors do respect the GPL when it comes to *kernel* drivers where it applies. They may not upstream them themselves but they do make the code available that others can clean up and upstream.

The problem on Android (in contrast to Linux on a PC or even embedded Linux on ARM) is that a lot of the hardware support depends on user space HALs rather than the kernel. 

To take a trivial example, to control the display backlight and the indicator LEDs there is a HAL layer called ""liblights"" that the vendor implements in code. But the kernel already provides a sysfs interface for this that Android could have used together with lots of backlight and LED drivers.

Because this HAL code is in userspace not the kernel   the GPL doesn't apply and so vendors can, and do, ship closed source HALs.

If Google were to remove most of the userspace HALs and push hardware support to the kernel where it belongs (and mostly is on other Linux platforms) much of the update problem would go away because vendors would be forced to ship most of their hardware support code in the kernel and the community could maintain it after they lose interest.

Unfortunately Google doesn't seem to be going this route...",1

h10h9kh,i-like-to-be-wooshed,0,7,"#from the article:

When we set out earlier this year to reimagine Firefox for desktop to be simpler, more modern and faster to use, we didn‚Äôt forget about your Apple mobile devices. We use our laptops and computers for work and play, but our tablets and phones sit a lot closer. They‚Äôre the first screens we see in the morning, and the last we see before we go to bed.

Firefox is only one of the many apps you use throughout the day, so our browser can‚Äôt just look good. It also needs to feel at home. The newest Firefox for iOS and iPadOS represents what we think online life should be: fast, beautiful and private ‚Äì presented in a package that looks and feels intuitive and natural.

It‚Äôs fast

You can already one-tap to go to your top sites, and we‚Äôve brought the same speed to search. Every time Firefox or a new tab opens, the keyboard will now come up, ready for you to start searching right away.

When typing takes too long, you can build search suggestions word by word.

Firefox syncs your bookmarks, history, passwords and more between devices. But when you have many tabs open on your iPhone, iPad and computer, they‚Äôre often hard to find. Now you can simply start typing the tab‚Äôs name, and Firefox will show the tabs you have opened, no matter where they‚Äôre located.

And if you don‚Äôt quite know what something is called, you can browse for it easily. Open the main application menu, and all your bookmarks, history, downloads and reading list are there.



It‚Äôs beautiful

We‚Äôve rebuilt parts of Firefox in native components, making it feel more iPhone and iPad-like than ever before. You‚Äôll notice design elements that look and work identically to those found in many other apps, so our browser feels instantly familiar. We‚Äôve also taken a major step up in accessibility. Firefox now supports more text sizes and integrates better with screen readers.

Our menus take up less space and work like all other menus you‚Äôre used to.







All your tabs, including ones synced from other devices, now appear side by side. And your bookmarks, history, downloads and reading list are browsed just like tabs do. Switching between them is a breeze.








And we‚Äôve given Firefox for iPadOS the same productivity-inspired new tab design, simplified navigation and streamlined menus. Your favourite browser now looks and feels consistent, no matter where you are.


It‚Äôs private

The App Store now includes app privacy labels that help you understand our data collection practices.


Here‚Äôs what we collect and why:

When you sign into your Firefox account with your email, you‚Äôll receive updates about all the awesome things happening at Mozilla in your inbox. You can manage your Newsletter subscriptions here.
You may choose to share information about feature usage, crashes and other technical data with us. We collect them, but we do not link them to your Firefox account identity! This information helps us improve Firefox performance and stability, and to support our marketing. You can read more about it here.
What‚Äôs next for Firefox

We‚Äôre excited to share a fast, beautiful and private Firefox experience across all your devices. No matter what device you choose to tackle the web in the future, Firefox will be there for you. Download the latest version of Firefox for your iOS and Mac and to experience the latest fresh clean look and feel.",0

Nobody cares about the amount of wallpaper apps and if you need more specialized apps, most of the time you have to buy an iPhone anyway. But you need all the basic apps like banking, communication and public transportation to participate.

I still think it would be possible to convince the companies to join a second android app store, if it's done right.

I don't know how iTunes worked before, but if you're subscribed to Apple Music you can upload 100k songs in there and they'll be available.

Now, if he did purchase the song through iTunes and now they want extra $$$ to be able to stream them, that's shitty. If not, I don't see anything wrong with the situation and wouldn't call it ""controlling the data"".

As for the right to repair thing, I totally agree, Apple and honestly many other corps should really stop doing that, but that was beside my question.",1

Not smartwatches though. Patents cover functionality and implementation, it doesn't matter that it *looks* like something that existed on an entirely different product before.",1
h1062en,ok___google,0,4,"&gt;The thing is, their individual products aren't going to always be very good.

Not sure what you mean by this? At least for most of their major product categories (iPhone, iPad, Mac), they all work just fine by themselves? I mean, I used a MacBook Pro for about 3 years with an Android before I switched to iOS. It was still a fantastic computer by itself even without the added ecosystem benefits with the iPhone.

Same with the iPhone. You don‚Äôt need to invest in an ecosystem with a MacBook to make it work well. There are plenty of people who use iPhone and Windows.

The iPhone works just fine individually without a Mac, and vice versa. They work *better* when they‚Äôre paired with each other obviously, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they don‚Äôt work well individually.

Macs were just fine before M1 too; I wouldn‚Äôt say that they were in a ‚Äúrough spot‚Äù. Have you personally used them before? Because they definitely weren‚Äôt bad before M1. M1 just made them better.

&gt;but if I had an apple watch, homepod, airpods, air tags etc?

I‚Äôll 100% agree with you that their more ‚Äúminor‚Äù products like airtags and airpods are not going to be as functional when paired with other brands. With the exception of the Apple Watch (and maybe the HomePod? Idk, I was never interested in that product line), each of those devices can be used with other brands, albeit some features will not be available. I guess you can consider this as the ‚Äúlock in‚Äù, which forces you to stick to Apple in order to get the full and best experience, which is fair.

But at the same time, again, if all these devices from Apple offer you the best possible experience with each other, what reason is there really to switch to something else? If you‚Äôre already that deep in the ecosystem, what reason is there to suddenly drop it? I guess if you want to try something new once in a while, which is fair.

The way I look at it, if it offers me the best experience across all my devices, and I enjoy the way things work so well together, you can call it ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù all you want lol I don‚Äôt care. That said, your comment is a good insight into a different perspective from mine though, so thanks!!",1

h106m8n,BojackShadowFax25,0,-1,"I agree that he presented the effects of root inaccurately, but perhaps it came down more to poor explanation on his part. I think he tried to make a video that highlighted the possible drawbacks of rooting a device, while not outright discouraging root to normal users who might be put off by the process.

&gt; Those are just 2 examples of myths that are found on this video.

I do think this is a bit harsh. I'd call them inaccuracies more than myths, because there is a degree of truth to everything he said. His reasons were:

1. Voiding the warranty: this is still true in many countries (mine included), and for some manufacturers like Samsung, is irreversible. 
1. Bricking the phone: you can 100% soft brick a device by improperly rooting it. Depending on how well implemented TWRP support it, sometimes simply running TWRP as the custom recovery with Magisk ends up bootlooping the device.
1. Broken apps: this was why I stopped rooting my main device a few years ago- my bank and company apps simply refused to work, no matter what Magisk signature spoofing hackery I performed, and at best, any fix was temporary. Sure, YMMV of course, but you won't know until you've already rooted the device.
1. No native system updates: again, I've found this to be true even on a Pixel. Not once did I receive an OTA update while rooted on my 2 XL. Hell, even a custom kernel stopped these from working.
1. Malware and hacking: so this is something I feel he didn't do a proper job explaining. Rooting the phone requires an unlocked bootloader, which does expose an element of risk to the device in that it can be compromised. Pixel phones display a warning splash screen each time the device is booted due to this.
1. Performance issues: another poorly explained point. Rooting alone does not lead to performance issues. Using root-requiring performance enhancement apps most definitely will, and I think the point he was trying to make was that it's not a silver bullet for solving performance issues with your phone, it can actually create further issues if improperly used. I'm sure you're familiar with the legions of uneducated XDA members decrying the performance of their devices, and regular feedback is often ""root and install mod X, phone is 1000% faster no lag"" sort of nonsense. I understood his point at targeting those people.

People familiar and comfortable with rooting won't experience most of these issues in any event, but novices are very likely to.

I found it odd that he didn't mention requiring some knowledge of command line tools such as adb, and that fixing root-related issues also means needing a dedicated PC. I think they're more important points that would serve as better warnings into the risk.",1

h109zmm,RiskyKitten,0,-2,"Well, just look at it from my side.

1. My phone is only two years old (introduced to the market in fall '19) and it won't be updated to Android 12, because when the manufacturer starts rolling out the update sometime near Christmas my phone will be ineligible.


2. Having Pixel would be a good choice but Google doesn't sell them over here [in Russia].


3. Google experience over here is inferior to what it shows at Google IOs and advertises everywhere else. A lot of features don't get localised and are either cut from the services or don't work as intended. Google Assistant in Russian is stuck with features from years before. It can't keep the conversation, can't execute newer commands and basically just gives you search results. That's it. It has trouble speaking Russian language properly and just sucks.


4. And then there is Apple. It sells new iPhones within a month of them being available on the US market. Updates them for eternity. And guess what. Siri over here understands Russian better and is more helpful than Google Assistant. 


So, yeah. What would you choose over here when it's like that?",1
h10a0k6,OctagonViolence,0,3,"Actually, I am still on the Note 9 (that's why I appreciate your review a lot).

But the problem is this feature doesn't seem to make exceptions well. I would no longer be able to receive E-Mail notifications, my messenger app (Signal) would not receive messages while WhatsApp had a delay and well... Tinder would only work with my display on.

Such a pity. A 30% CPU reduction without any other compromises would be such a useful feature.",1
h10a0nd,marincelo,0,4,"My advice - turn on Always-On Display. It will make you forget about the notification light and it will help with the unlocking. I rarely see my lock screen because I'm either looking at AOD or unlocked phone. No need to tap the power button, just place your finger on the sensor and you're good to go.

Having said that, I really miss power button fingerprint sensor from my Xperia XZ1 - it was much faster and it never missed to read my print. With S21 Ultra, it's hit and miss, I sometimes need to fall back to PIN unlock since I get frustrated trying to align my finger on the sensor.",1

What I mean is that they're absolutely not losing by any metric. Android is too big and too powerful. Considering the difference between Apple's powerful chipsets vs the competition, Android flagships should have disappeared, and yet they are strong.

Some of us want to be free (or more free) and would rather spend money on a less supported device that gives us choice and freedom, than paying for a well cared powerful toy. And some people just want to pay less. OEMs know that, and so does Google, that's why there's no urgency.

I like to game on my phone so I want the bigger screen of the max, my question is how much better is the max pro camera compared to just the pro? Or the regular 12?

My wife now is always borrowing my phoen because it takes better pics than hers.

She doesn‚Äôt want a huge phone so are the other 12s that much worse than the max?

But I do agree that Apple's photo organization workflow is garbage compared to pretty much everything else I have used previously. I have literally stopped taking as many photos simply because the ""our way or no way"" approach is off putting. For a phone that is always touted as having an amazing camera they sure hobbled their gallery, plus no Pro mode in the stock camera app ... what?

h0vs8id,Sad-Excitement9311,0,1,thanks,1
h0vsaxo,mavispuford,0,50,"I've got a P4XL, and this is my favorite thing about Soli. I turned off the swipe gestures for music, but I'm really gonna miss the reach to wake feature if it's gone...",1
h0vsbh6,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,7,"That was far from the only problem. The main problem is that it solves a problem that no-one had. It's pointless on a phone. There are other problems too, like the terrible accuracy of it thanks to the teeny tiny actual soli sensor, when all their PR vids of Soli outside of the Pixel were using sensors the size of a game console.

&gt;A use case I can think of right now while listening to Spotify is just waving your hand over your phone to skip tracks.

But you could also just press the next button on the screen, since your hand is already within like 10cm of the phone.

Another big problem with soli is that it has no way of telling *who* is doing the gestures. Out in public with your phone in your hand? Whoops someone walked past too close and triggered a soli motion gesture and now your music skipped track.",1
h0vsct7,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,3,"But in reality it makes no difference, because by the time you pick it up it's already woken without soli.",1
h0vsh80,EnemiesInTheEnd,0,-52,"Even when it works, it is still awful. Poor displays, terrible UI/design, poor quality control, beta software, weak battery life, etc. They've never been very good. Even the camera isn't all that great.",1

h0vt3oe,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,1,Gestures because they're easier to use with how I hold my phone. My thumb is kept basically in the middle of the screen so it's much easier to swipe back on the side than it is to press back down the bottom. Swiping up is the only other gesture you need which is the same effort as pressing home and less effort than pressing the task switcher button.,1
h0vtc01,JshKlsn,0,11,"&gt; Not really. iPhones are unlocked the second you look at them. Face ID doesn't take long to ""wake up"".

It's still faster. I had both Pixel 4 XL and iPhone X. Pixel 4/XL has the best face unlock of any phone out there currently thanks to Soli. Facts.",1
h0vtcz7,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,0,"&gt; Buttons are just more responsive and less prone to error, plus they take away far less of your usable screen space.

Yes, Pixel phone designs are always years behind. The new Pixel phone is expected to look pretty much exactly like my Note10+ in the front. Pixel phones have always looked outdated at release.

Android would not go through such transition. Fuchsia can (and most probably will) include an Android runtime that will run apps exactly the same way Android does today (no difference in performance, etc).

That said, they will probably remove that Android Runtime (say after 10-12 years from release Fuchsia), when majority of apps are available on Flutter itself.

Its possible that Google may provide build tools within Android SDK to compile Android apps for flutter.  


Also, Android and Fuchsia may get new versions together for few more years (so that Android devices are not abandoned and can be updated for few more years by OEMs, but also giving OEMs time to transition to Fuchsia for devices they release after release of Fuchsia).",1

Have you seen the 100s of articles from people, including professionals, who are very happy with ipad pro apps?

Its irrelevant really, apple is playing the long game and allowing ipad devs time toi grow from scratch while creating apps specifically for ipad, the ipad ui and ipad users.  And they are coming along very nicely

In case you haven;t figured it out yet, if you want to run mac apps, your one and only choice is a mac and will remain so. Apple has no intention of bringing warmed over mac apps to ipad and shitting on the ipad devs they have carefully cultivated",0

I guess you're still stuck in the 90's. Real power users use full screen apps and virtual desktops with various fast methods of switching

Its much better for your focus and productivity. Its why apple has put so much effort into their virtual desktop design on mac. Glad to let you in on the secret

AR will play a bigger role in Android. Maybe there'll also he some first successors to Google Glasses.

Bigger batteries, super quick charging (less than 15 minutes 10% - 90%)

More input options, like tapping the back or squeezing the phone, will be normal. Charging port, volume and power button will all stay.

Something that already exists today but is considered a gimmick will be popular. Maybe screens on the back?

Right now, Android 12 is making headlines and will be released soon. It's the first major redesign in a while. I'd predict its look is slowly evolving back to Android 11 in the coming years.

&gt;You also have to agree to Xiaomi/Poco/etc terms of service when you start the phone for the first time. Either MIUI/Xiaomi apps are so bad that they require additional permissions or they're doing a bad job and require users to accept the same terms multiple times.


That's a false dichotomy. Them being upfront about their policies is not ""doing a bad job"". 

&gt;There is no ""burden"". The only downside is that it uses a few megabytes of space, which is not really a problem when you have GBs of space (and the pre-installed crap confirms that they don't mid) and also saves data.

You call already installed apps crap. If they do it this way, you would call that crap too. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 


&gt;And this assuming that some apps require internet connection at all. On my X3 NFC, the filters on the camera apps worked out of the box without being connected to the internet.

Try the movie mode and vlog mode and you will know. 



&gt;Anyone that has run a server knows that logs are optional. If you decide to keep logs, then often there's no need to keep personal data, keep it for a long time or even make money with them.

Usually the servers are in China and they have pretty extensive data retention policies. 





&gt;You don't need internet access to do that. In fact, you'll find apps on F-Droid that show you the time from different places, work offline and receive updates via traditional means. 

They just choose to not do it that way. And they are letting you know about it, instead of keeping you in dark. 



&gt;The problem is doing things in a way that requires the user to accept a privacy policy, not being ""upfront"".

You don't have to accept them. You can choose not to and use different apps anyday. 

&gt;If you think that a camera app *needs* internet access or logging on a remote server just to take a photo or record a video, then I'm sorry to say, but you're wrong.


I have time and again tried to explain that why is that happening. And they are providing those features because social media is a big part phone usage these days and these features makes it quite easy to make posts. 


&gt;There's also a problem with your thinking. The ""oh, but Google has access to your data, so it's fine for everyone to have it too"" and ""but... Samsung also does it!!!"" are terrible excuses for bad practices.


These are excuses only when you want to single out Xiaomi when it is actually a pretty standard practise. 

&gt;If you accept to send your data to Google, it doesn't mean that it's fine for Facebook to have access to it too. 

Never said it is. I just explained the reasoning of why they have different eula for different apps and why some apps need them. 



&gt;My point is very simple and clear: Collecting data about users is bad for us. I don't like it. (You're free to love the practice and defend it.)

Just because I happen to know why does not mean I either love it or defend it. I just like the fact that these companies are upfront about it, unlike Google. 



&gt;Yet, when you sideload an apk, the installer scans the app for virus (not Google Play Protect). Maybe my X3 NFC is special.

You don't need to agree to any eula for that. It's part of their custom installer. 


&gt;I didn't make any comments about MIUI's aesthetics. 

Sorry for that last part. I incorrectly said that, it was said by some other user and I mistakenly thought it was you. 


&gt;If other MIUI users have no issues, then good for them.

That's most of the time is the case. My mom used redmi 4 for 3+ years and it had no lag issues.",1
h0rspwz,Mekfal,0,1,"I'm gonna make a few less USA-focused prediction over here.

* Google Pay is going to be available in at least as many countries and banks as Apple Pay is available now
* Under-display front cameras are going to be standard
* Many USA-only features, like call screening, will still be very much USA-only.
* Samsung already is but will basically be the only Android 99% of people will hold alongside Xiaomi.
* We might actually get a unified messaging system, with Google and Samsung partnering up, this seems to be likely to happen. 
* Headphone jacks fully gone, true wireless buds very cheap to manufacture. On some phones even the charging port is gone in the name of waterproofing and style. (And the environment obviously even though wireless charging wastes a shit ton of energy) 
* Google offers 5-6 years of Android software updates because of its custom SoC.
* We MIGHT see a few graphene batteries pop up here and there. Though Li-Ion batteries are going to be pretty good with newer chips and offer basically 10 hours of SoT on most flagship models.  
* More talk about Android that is suited to you, with the help of AI and Machine learning, god knows how much shit they can put in under the name of AI. 
* We're going to see budget foldables pop-up, they'll have plastic screens while flagships have a more durable, bendable glass. A few Rollable devices on their way. 
* Android and iOS get even more similar, with them copying features off of one another. Chip performance between A(whatever number) and Qualcomm/Exynos (whatever number) is very much inconsequential and they are very very close to one another. 
* ARM based laptops and even desktops will appear more widely, ChromeOS is going to be much much more popular and if they lock down Android Apps to only run on ChromeOS and not other ARM based devices (Partnership with Windows maybe), it's going to have a very big market.",1

Phones would be more integrated in our lives, as in not only car keys, but house keys, travel cards/passes, IDs, nearly everything that can be digitized would be in a phone. 

Companies would create proprietary security solutions, e.g. Knox.

Phone brands like Nokia would either disappear or be bought by a corporation, only strong (read with a lot of money) brands would remain.

I suppose we might see revival of accessories like dummy tablets and laptops, where you have to connect/insert your phone in order to fire them up.

Continuity would be a standard.

Microsoft would try to rival Apple level of integration by closely integrating with android in general, not only Samsung. Mostly due to the fact that Windows keeps on loosing market share and as of 2026 would be around 60%.

Apple might try to allow some integrations with Android in order to capture more market share for MacOS.

If you are not tied to Apple's ecosystem, Android is pretty good.

Samsung is the best in this regard (3 years vs 5 years), but you must know that sooner or later you'll have to rely on Lineage OS and its community for the new versions of Android, in which case banking apps, etc. may be less secure, esp. with derivative ROMs like the ones found on xda-developers dot com...",1

Now I think the biggest issue would probably be how locked down it is, but when I think about how often I download 3rd party apps/files, it's not too often, and it's not really something I NEED. I feel like it is just more of a convenience to know that I CAN download something if I need to, even though I rarely do on Android devices.

That said, I did upgrade from an S8 to an iPhone 12. My main reason was that I was bored with Android; I don't like where Google has been taking it in recent iterations and I was intrigued by the newest iOS version.    
I'm liking that the experience is more overall consistently good. With android, even with all the customization and pro features, there were always some little things that were unpolished - usually individual apps, but often Google's own fault. In iOS, it just fits together better.     
I can't do as many things, but the things that I can do are polished, straight forward and work exactly as you'd expect. For example, Tasker on Android can achieve anything, but it's a pain to use and I would often encounter little bugs - shortcuts on iOS can only do a fraction of what Tasker offered, but those things are easy to do and work flawlessly.      
I haven't felt particularly locked in either, but then again I never used torrents on my phone. Other than that, most of the things that I used in android (third party launchers, custom widgets, sideloading apps...), I haven't actually needed on iOS so I haven't missed them.

h0okfoq,tramtruong1002,0,1,My carrier is selling the iphone 12 mini for $807 CAD (a $200 CAD discount compared to the Apple store). Would it be worth it if I buy it right now or should I wait for september?,0
h0olklm,GROMKOUR,0,1,"I reckon apple knows that their products are more for the working person or anyone who is the only android user in the house because Apple is amazing when it comes to apple-apple product interaction like copying on an iPhone and pasting on a Mac. airdrop  and they provide a lot more security whether it be when downloading things off the internet or just the App Store itself as everything in it has been scanned for viruses (from what I've heard, \*which is one of the reasons\* a lot of android apps don't come to apple)   anyway if I was wrong anywhere please correct me. this is just what I know/understand",0

h0opp2k,i-like-to-be-wooshed,0,199,"In a report published this morning, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says that customers should expect stricter privacy controls, updates to iPad multitasking aimed at attracting advanced users, and new notification modes. The incoming iOS notification banner is said to be redesigned, with more of a focus on auto-reply actions. There will also be interface updates for Apple TV and Apple Watch.

Bloomberg had previously said that the iPadOS 15 update will allow users to place home screen widgets anywhere, like the iOS 14 iPhone behavior ‚Ä¶

In regard to privacy, iOS 15 is apparently going to feature a new control panel that will highlight how apps use customer data. This sounds like it will build upon the existing App Tracking Transparency policies rolled out as part of iOS 14.5.

As customers and tech reviewers demand ways to extract more productivity out of their shiny new iPad Pros, Apple is said to be readying a Home Screen revamp and updates to multitasking.

Bloomberg says Apple plans a new design for multitasking that will ‚Äúmake it easier to operate multiple apps at the same time‚Äù. Apple intends to make the iPad ‚Äúmore appealing‚Äù for advanced uses, according to the report.

iOS 15 notifications will reportedly allow users to set a status (like sleeping, working, driving) and have notification alerts behave differently for each mode. The incoming notification banners will also get a new user interface design on both iPhone and iPad, with a renewed emphasis on auto-reply features.

tvOS for Apple TV and watchOS for Apple Watch are described as getting ‚Äòenhancements‚Äô to user interface and health tracking. Bloomberg says it expects the new version of macOS will be minor, following the UI overhaul that came last year with Big Sur.

Echoing earlier reporting from Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Joanna Stern, Bloomberg says there will also be a focus on new features for the Health and Messages apps.",0

It's not even used most of the times on Sony phones and 4K on phone screens has the same drawbacks as QHD had when it was new on phones. Higher resolution, yes, but overall worse quality.

Now I'm not talking about what happens in a few years. If 4K phone screens eventually become standard and are equal or better in quality than QHD screens, why not? I just don't see the point in compromising right now, especially when QHD+ 120Hz are just getting good.",1

I'll give you an example. When Samsung updated to their last android version, everyone went mad over it because when you inserted a sim card, a lot of phones became simply incapable of reading them until that update is fixed. Crazy isn't it? The one thing a phone needs to do and it can't be done because of lack of polish and poor implementation. Oh, except that it wasn't Samsung, but actually that's the reality with iOS 14.5 on a wide variety of phones. 

As for the whole face id thing, the technology is cool. That's undeniable. One of the most well thought out implementations of infrared. Most well polished facial recognition system on a smartphone? Well it's really only competing with the pixel 4, so it's a low bar but sure. Of course, it had a negative affect on the rest of the phone with the notch covering a fair amount of screen, but then the pixel was a fugly monstrosity so it's kind of moot there.

Not necessarily, if FB wins, Apple could abandon it's privacy-oriented strategy and do what Facebook and Google have been doing. That would not benefit consumers and even less the ""littleman"".

What does benefit us all is having multiple viable and different eco systems e.g. Apple and Android. This spurs competition and benefits us all. however, ideally there would be at least three viable platforms, which is why I'm sad that Microsoft's failed.

I agree with you on a philosophical basis, but it all falls to dust when I can answer my ringing iPhone on my MacBook or copy from my MacBook into my Mac mini with everything seamlessly syncing in the background.

This approach is measurably delivering on productivity, so e.g. IBM measured a 10% increase in productivity. Considering people cost IBM $300k a year, this translates into $30k a year, more than enough to pay the higher costs, which are actually investments into productivity or savings.",1

1TB on a Mini is not crazy at all. I think they have 1TB microSD now. MicroSD is shit for read/write speeds, but we *can* get that much storage in that small of space. So for people thinking only the biggest iPhones should have that much space, there's no real reason to assume they need that space for... that much space.

The LiDAR thing is kind of surprising, but since nobody's really doing anything with it, putting it on all models makes sense. The 12 and 12 Mini sold extremely well, and having them not have the feature means most iPhone users didn't get LiDAR, which meant app developers weren't incentivized to support it.

But even if you don't they're likely still tracking you - all the big companies do ""fingerprinting"" where they make a unique record for matching up a specific browser or device. If you go to a website that has Google ads it marks your machine with a unique reference. Next website you visit with Google ads now knows you were on both sites. Repeat for all sites with Google ads.
The real tracking is when you login, as then Google can track what sites you're on across mobile and desktop, and across browsers etc.
Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, they all do similar, no real accounts needed, but it's even more obvious when you have one.

The companies involved all benefit, and this process means ads users receive are more relevant and helpful.

But many people don't understand this and think it's Facebook watching over your shoulder and selling the fact you suck at bubble bobble to someone.",1

macOS also didn't really ""change"". You use it as you always have, you develop for it as always, you just end up compiling against a different architecture. The changes are so deep that 90% of users and developers will not notice it.

Also Google didn't bring Android to PC because - why would they? They have the Chromebook, why compete with yourself? Android was never made for the PC and would need to drastically change its UI and input methods to be decent on the PC, and even then it could never really compete with Windows, macOS, Linux or even Chromebook.

If Google stops Android development, another player might just continue where Google left off and provide this version of Android to all OEMs that will gladly accept it so they don't need to start their established mobile businesses from scratch. Google will end up being the only one producing Fuchsia devices, questionable support for todays Android apps, and OEMs simply won't follow unless they have the same or even more freedom than with Android.

If OEMs were keen to switch, why don't they start producing Fuchsia devices right now? I mean its there, its in v1.0, its open source. Because it makes no sense.

Imagine the damage done to Google if a product they developed for 10+ years was just given to someone else to continue profiting off it and taking all partners with them.

There isn't a better phone out there for 599. The only one that might be comparable is the Asus rogue 3 but that isnt 599.

The only extra things you‚Äôll need depends on what bricks you have. If you have usb c bricks then you‚Äôll just need to buy a usb c to lightening cable $20. If you have usb bricks then buy the usb to lightening cable $20.

It would be wonderful if AMD came out and started supporting their GPUs for 5-6 years, or perhaps even longer if we're lucky.

h065ds5,BojackShadowFax25,0,4,"&gt; Sure the compression is good and most people won't notice but it's *worse* than original quality. 

I mean, that's fairly obvious,  and Google never suggested otherwise. [The setting itself had a fairly understandable description](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Photos-High-quality-vs-Original-Whats-the-difference-and-should-you-care_id93938):


&gt; First thing's first, let's see what Google has to say about both quality settings:

&gt; High quality:

&gt; * Unlimited free storage
* Photos are compressed to save space. If a photo is larger than 16 MP, it will be resized to 16 MP.
* Videos higher than 1080p will be resized to high-definition 1080p. A video with 1080p or less will look close to the original.

&gt; Original quality:

&gt; * Limited free storage (15GB)
* All photos and videos are stored in the same resolution that you took them.
* Recommended for photos that have more than 16MP and videos with more than 1080p.

It wasn't misleading outside of how bad the video compression is. But for photos, it was accurate and understandable. The Verge article was just farming for clicks, as per usual.",1

Have you ever heard of Yuzu? You can run it (today!) on Radeon GPUs that have zero compatibility with the NVN API. NVN isn't even available on normal Nvidia GPUs, yet you can still use Yuzu to emulate the Switch easily. Crazy I know!

Emulation doesn't just mean running games, but also improving them. You can install mods for Breath of the Wild in CEMU, which you cannot do in Switch. You can play games at a much higher resolution if you have the power, you can play at higher framerates, etc.

Sure, Samsung's Radeon GPU might not be enough to run BotW on Yuzu at 1080p 60FPS, but it's a first step towards that direction.",1

h066ifp,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,5,"FSR will struggle to be anywhere near as impressive as DLSS, especially on phone hardware. DLSS has to have its model trained per game and then uses dedicated GPU hardware to do the Upscaling. Even then on those games it‚Äôs still noticeably worse than native resolution when there‚Äôs movement on screen. A ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù version is going to be much less accurate you‚Äôd assume. The nVidia Shield TV Pro has a one size fits all ‚Äúmachine learning AI‚Äù upscaler and it‚Äôs pretty garbage, end result is almost identical to a software sharpening filter. 

The thing that this will have going for it is that on a small online screen you‚Äôll be less likely to notice the graphical problems it causes. But in the other hand, is this even needed for phone games? 1080p isn‚Äôt exactly a huge resolution, and there are very few 4K phones, so where is the need for machine learning Upscaling to 4K on phones?

The GPU side is absolutely incredible, Ray tracing and probably FSR on a mobile chip will be huge, but the CPU side on Exynos has been nothing but disappointment in the last 5 years, every single one has ran hotter, consumed more battery and performed slower than the equivalent Snapdragon variant. 

I've sworn to never buy an Exynos after using the S10e for two years, absolutely making me miserable with the way it heats up and sucks battery with 2-3hr SOTs. They would really have to up their efficiency game, but even then it lacks adoption, emulators such as Dolphin run way better on Snapdragon than on Exynos. It's a hard one.

DLSS 1.0 required per game training, but DLSS 2.0+ does not require per game training

DLSS 1.9 just ran on the GPU shaders, not using Tensor cores

The Shield TV Pro's AI Upscaling isn't comparable, it doesn't take as many inputs, e.g. no motion vectors, previous frames, etc and is design for Nvidia's Tegra Maxwell GPU from 2015

Unreal's [Temporal Super Resolution (TSR) also seems to work well without requiring per game training or Tensor cores](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/nozuvo/testing_unreal_engine_5_temporal_super_resolution/)

Even if FSR on mobile doesn't match DLSS, it can still be a gamechanger if it allows ray tracing, reduces GPU load or increases performance",1

- the popup that appears when selecting text doesn't show options from 3rd party apps
- you can't change the lock screen wallpaper unless you use the stock gallery 
- the fancier dark mode in MIUI 12 often messed up the status bar icons colors, making them practically illegible in some apps 
- you can't set the camera shortcut on the lock screen to open anything but the stock camera

gzy9p2i,Berzerker_90,0,1,"Hey there.

I had Samsung for a very very long time and i would not say i was ever satisfied by any of their phones.

I live outside the USA so i always get the Exynos version, i wasn't aware of it until it became a hit and people started taking about it.

I saw a SD version for sale in my country but ofc it doesn't support any signals here and it's not covered by warranty...this alone made me realize that this shit ain't right...why the hell would you make 3 different devices and just have so many different rules.

Apple make all iphones the same and they all support every carriers around the globe... it's much more international and covered literally anywhere.

Anyways, i had the exynos s21ultra on the day of release, it was nice but def not worth the price...after couple of days Samsung started dropping prices like crazy and that was it ....i went and traded it for a 12pm.

The phone is great and feels unbelievably premium....great cameras, battery is a keeper...fast as fuk...and it does the job and plenty....what else would i need from a phone!!!??

And above all, it hold value for years to come...so i wouldn't tear up when selling it after a year.

I have a 2nd android phone, budget one and it sever me enough when i need to download or that freedom android offers, other than that, iphone rocks.",0
gzy9stp,HelpfulCherry,0,1,"A lot of the time, devices are subsidized by the carriers. For example, I got a Galaxy Note 10+ and a Note 10 on a buy one, get one free deal and then when switching to iPhones for my spouse and I, our carrier was offering $700 off an iPhone 12 with an eligible trade-in. So the MSRP on my N10+ may have been $1100, but in reality I paid $550, and then the MSRP on my 12 Pro Max is $1200, but with the $700 off from trading in the N10+ that makes it $500. $500 for the 12PM, $550 for the N10+, and that's $1050 over two years for two flagship devices with a combined MSRP of $2300.

Similar story for my spouse, except they got the normal Note 10 (not plus) and normal 12 (not pro). $550 for the N10, $850 - $700 = $150 for the 12, and they're only out $700 for two phones in two years with a combined MSRP of $1800.

So in a timespan (about 18 months) where we *would* have paid $4100 total for four devices if they were all bought at MSRP, carrier deals &amp; incentives means we only paid $1750. Or if you average it out, between the two of us, we've only paid about $438/phone.

Also, for some people, it just isn't that big of a deal to drop the money on something they use every single day. I certainly value having a nice phone and was routinely upgrading yearly when I was using Android phones, even at times where I didn't have any special incentives or deals.",0

You thought watching 60hz streams or video drains your battery faster when it doesn't because it drops the hz to match the video fps. Worst case scenario you're losing ~25% battery life if 120hz mode is forced on. Most real world uses you'll be losing ~5-10% battery life which is going to be negligible because battery life is already so good these days.

You might get used to it until you go back to a 60hz phone and realize how much worse it is. Then you'll swear off 60hz phones like most people who use a high hz phone. Which is why most phone companies are switching to a high hz phone. The pros far outweighs the battery life impact.

Android doesn't have a Google analytics tracker inside the os that tracks what the user is doing in every app and then reports back to google for them to build the profile on you.

1st party Tracking is the tracking platform developed by app developers, which only big app developers actually have. This means that that data stays on the developer's servers (regardless of who is the hosting provider).

What almost every app has is 3rd party Tracking integrated and there are numerous providers like: google/firebase analytics, Facebook, adjust, localytics, etc. This is cheaper than building and maintaining your own tracking platform and also means you can track the user across multiple apps and devices and cross sell ads on other platforms if you use some of these platforms.

Long answer: eventually, it'll pop up on Amazon with a slightly inflated price from a 3rd party seller.

Almost all users are logged in with their Gmail, and are already giving Google copious amounts of data to target ads on (location, web history and search results, app install stats, app usage stats, in-app purchase stats, etc.).

Even with ATT, none of these would change, since it's all *Android* data, which is first-party to Google. What would change would be the ability of third-party ad networks to compete with Google, and effectively target ads. Basically, ATT would mean that Google's ad targeting capabilities stay the same, while all their competitors' get much, much worse. That's very obviously anti-competitive behavior.",1

The Note 10 had some sweet multi tasking functionality. Like setting up a short cut for a variety of split screen apps.

gzv3af4,k7_u,0,1,"I honestly haven‚Äôt used it enough to compare the cameras that much.  The telephoto on the note 20 ultra is way better, but apart from that they both have taken incredible photos for phones. 
I can comment on a couple things‚Ä¶ the sky in iPhone photos is so exaggerated, it looks dumb, but only some times, it‚Äôs AI improvements are really quite bad in this area, the colours wrong and all, whereas the note20u always looks more natural in the sky‚Äôs .
But come nighttime photos, the iPhone is untouched.
I am still amazed how damn good the low light photos are from the iPhone. 
In general, the iPhone photos are indeed better.

Not sure if your PAL, but a BIG issue with the iPhone is it doesn‚Äôt shoot 50FPS, but does shoot 25,30,60. 
Whereas you can shoot 50FPS with the note 20.
So if indoors, or want to use video from another device, it really is not a great option unless your targeting 25fps.
But, you can get around this with filmic pro, get 50fps, with a huge caveat.
It won‚Äôt shoot HDR at 4K over 30fps
But it will shoot HDR at 1080p up to 60 including 50.
The lack of 50FPS is a real obvious missing feature.
Considering it‚Äôs videos are so damn good, this is a real let down.  Obviously most people don‚Äôt care, because it‚Äôs a software issue they still haven‚Äôt fixed.

We also have the exynoss990 in our note20u and it‚Äôs not bad. 

The pro in the name of the iphone means nothing, it‚Äôs just a big iPhone.
It does have more usable screen space than the smaller ones, it‚Äôs not just a blown up UI.",0

I also appreciate their service here in the US, because you get the free year of ‚ÄúApple Care‚Äù and can go right in if you need to. 

I tried Android a few times, and found that the bloatware drove me crazy. Eventually they get sluggish, support wanes for the OS, and apps tend not to work as well because the phones are such a huge variety of shapes and sizes and operating systems. I do like that they are cheaper, and they have a lot more customization options though. Apple is always behind in that way. I just always end up floating back to the iPhone because in the end it ‚Äújust works‚Äù so well. Also a bonus is you have other Apple products, they sync and work together flawlessly.

2. My iPhone 7 which I bought about 6 months after launch has 89%.  Although you can‚Äôt over charge a battery, I keep mine between 50% and 70% , a battery is at stress at high charge and low charge, that‚Äôs just a fact, nothing to do with software, but the chemistry . That‚Äôs why even Tesla recommends 80%.  
3.  Not all batteries are created equal.  For instance, if a battery is 3000mah, they sometimes have say 3125mah.  Hence the phone will say 100% health until it deteriates to 3000mah.  I used to have software on my Mac that could read this and cycle count.  It took a year before it hit the stated mah.  Your battery was prob close to the stated mah.

gzqbzl7,baldeagleNL,0,0,"Your argumentation is logical on a small scale, but also the reason a lot of evil exists in the world. 

Does it matter if I drop this piece of garbage in nature? That single piece of plastic? No, on a large scale in doesn't matter. 

Does it matter if I buy clothes made by child labor? If I wouldn't, would that make a big impact? No, it won't. 

Does it matter if I use more fresh water than necessary? Will the world change if I use less? No, it won't. 

Does it matter if I cheat the system and get a new phone for cheap, if I'm the only one? No, it doesn't. 

The fact it's logical on a small scale does make it logical in a large scale or, more importantly, morally good. If everyone thinks like this, nobody takes responsibility for anything, and before you know it everything is fucked up. 

If OP destroys his phone and gets a new one from Apple, that singlehandedly won't increase prices of Apple Care. But if enough people do it, it will and everyone else is going to pay the price. Is it OPs fault? I would argue he contributed just as much as everyone else, so yes.",0

If 10000 people do this, it might change. If every iPhone owner does this, Apple Care wouldn't exist tomorrow.

by the way, i guess as long as OP doesn't literally smash their phone to pieces and ask apple to replace it (i doubt they'll replace it without a charge; probably less than a non-applecare iphone users), that one repair at the end of the applecare period probably won't cost apple much considering how expensive applecare is. sure, in some cases when apple doesn't have the spare parts/labor to repair specific malfunctions and must resort to giving out replacement phones, the cost of that one phone may or may not be more expensive than applecare itself (it might be refurbished), but i doubt apple does that often from my own experience of apple repairs.",0

iOS definitely does feel smoother than Android, but not by *that* much. And Android feels faster than iOS, but also not by that much.

Pretty sure it started happening a few years ago already. You don't see USB-A on laptops anymore, for example. You see it less and less on phone chargers as well.

And the difference in cost is:

1. Marginal
2. Only a thing because of differences in volume. As more and more devices use the new connector, the price will drop more and more.

But really, price is already a non-issue for the vast majority of devices. Not to mention that USB-C is more space-effective.

Really, the fight is between micro-B and USB-C. USB-A is an inconsequential bystander here, because computers already all have USB-C ports (even if not exclusively), and all that's missing is for all peripherals to switch over. Once this becomes more mainstream (which it will), you will start seeing motherboards with multiple USB-C ports on the back and much fewer USB-A.",1

gzdn47v,experpernectu,0,5,"&gt; the only issue [with the iPhone SE] is ‚Äúbudget‚Äù model not having a price that reflects that.

It was $400 for 64GB, and $50 more for 128GB, $100 more ($500) for 256GB. That's budget. It was also $200 off, at launch, on Verizon and AT&amp;T, with no strings attached.

Also, performance wise, it kicked the crap out of every Android phone out there, some at over five times the price. Even if you look at the most expensive one, and set aside the discount (so, $500) and also set aside stupid expensive Droids like the Galaxy Fold, if you put it up against the top Galaxy Note, it's still like a third of the price - and kicks its ass in benchmarks.

I guess that may be the biggest problem. They probably do not want to open-source the drivers (or even cannot due to contracts with different chip manufacturers and intellectual property).

They could at least release binary (closed-source) drivers so that running Linux would be possible. Well, actually with root access, one can download such binary drivers from the \`system\` partition. I think this is what developers supporting different LineageOS devices usually do. However, such binary drivers get obsolete (eg. they have security issues) and manufacturers would not like to spend money maintaining them.

But yeah, it would be nice if some smart phone manufacturer made such upcycling program and at least released some basic software kit to easily unlock bootloader and compile Linux Kernel for their old devices. I think that this is all the community would need. Everything else could be figured out because it does not depend on manufacturers' ""secret sauce"".",1

That'd be the only way. It'd only work once too, since they'll find ways to sign the code for different employees after that - or maybe they already do. A man can hope. Somewhere across the world on a hard drive forgotten lies the key to using my 3 year old S9+ to it's full potential. I wish someone disruptive takes over the Samsung management and does things like this. It'd be almost unlimited free marketing if you ask me.

gzdb99j,Zero22xx,0,-5,"First time I've heard of Samsung Good Lock and I have to say it looks pretty good. Clearly Samsung have come a long way since TouchWiz and I kinda regret switching over to Nokia now, thinking that Nokia would actually be anywhere near their glory days.

If you can show me an app that can disable or change this f'n Google Assistant button, I'll suck your dick because even disabling it in the app manager has made zero difference to anything. Also, needing 3rd party apps for that? Great customisation there.

And as far as rooting goes, my biggest disappointment with this Nokia phone is that there seems to be zero custom firmwares or rooting solutions. As someone that has been running with custom firmwares forever now, it is still missed when it's no longer an option. LineageOS is so basic and AOSP-like that I'm not even sure what the point of it existing is but there are way better firmwares out there that allow you to do everything from remapping buttons to changing themes all from your settings app without the need of premium 'pro' versions of apps that do the same thing. And with custom firmwares, at least you can remove most of the suite of shite Google apps that come preinstalled, along with whatever other useless crapware the device manufacturers decided it needs.

I'm glad that you're still finding joy in these devices but for me personally, 'smart' phones seem to be turning into nothing much more than digital camera / portable Facebook devices because the memory management seems to be too terrible to handle more than two apps running at a time, or more than two tabs at a time in Firefox.

Maybe these are Nokia issues though. My Samsung S4 Mini finally died last year on Android 10 (having got this far thanks to custom firmwares) and handled a lot of what I threw at it fairly well. This Nokia? I wish I had done more research beforehand to see if they at least have custom firmwares in the first place because this thing is really starting to piss me off.",1

This is fundamental, and Google's desire to lock the platform into their own UI, despite being for good reasons, has proven a disaster for both Android TV and Wear. Only if customisable, OEMs will use (and improve) the software. Fragmentation, bad UI and bad performance are problems that occurred in the past due to Android's openness, but closing Android is not the solution. It is better to keep it open and let the market discard those devices that use bad software.

gz97cji,avengedjusty,0,1,"Honest opinion from someone who switched from a Samsung Galaxy S20+ to a base iPhone 12 - I can‚Äôt answer most of your questions since I haven‚Äôt had my iPhone long enough to accurately comment, but wanted to give a few thoughts. 

You mention being a college student? I‚Äôve literally started using my phone WAY more because I‚Äôm enjoying it so much more. It‚Äôs very fast, everything feels so slick and smooth. Navigation was a challenge but the lady who sold me this phone helped me. I‚Äôm 26 and generally good at figuring new things out but still needed that help. So if you‚Äôre impatient with stuff like that, might be a problem for you.

The screen IMHO is just way, way better. The camera as well. I don‚Äôt know how or why but they both are I actually googled it and think the res is higher in this phone than my s20+. Photos in the dark are crazy good too. 

I feel like this phone drains a little faster. But it also charges crazy fast. And like I stated I use it a lot more and heavily so maybe that‚Äôs why? It‚Äôs funny how there‚Äôs features on here that blew my mind like the button on the side that muted all sound. That‚Äôs a very standard old iPhone feature that felt revolutionary. 

One huge negative is the process of moving OS. Password wise it‚Äôs a real pain in the ass. But I also feel a lot more safe on iPhone. Especially using Safari. It took a solid day and a half to smooth out wrinkles in accounts. So back your stuff to the cloud. Write down passwords and be thorough. Also not to be blunt but any naughty photos in Samsung‚Äôs secure folder thing don‚Äôt get backed up to cloud so‚Ä¶.you‚Äôll loose them.

I could ramble on. But I‚Äôm trying to be objective. I switched and have ended up now with a MacBook. AirPods, and Apple Watch‚Ä¶I love the ecosystem they have created it‚Äôs all so seamlessly done and has a level of finesse I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. 

Last note, I didn‚Äôt realize it but Spotify has a college student discount. So does Apple Music, you can also pull your playlist etc over from Spotify to Apple Music using an app (I forget the name just google it). But anyway, Apple Music is $5 for college students. I also get Apple TV for $5 I think? Hope this helps.",0
gz97ky1,es_cl,0,2,"I started with an iPad in 2017, then a year later got iPhone and MBP at the same time, and now an Apple Watch last Nov. 

Now that it‚Äôs been a few years with the ‚ÄúApple ecosystem‚Äù, I can honestly say that an iPhone and MBP/MBA is really all you need. The iPad and AW are great products but they‚Äôre not as daily essentials as the iPhone and MB.",0
gz984lk,MrStruggleSnuggle,0,-1,Facebook don‚Äôt sell your data to third parties.,0
gz987gs,-K9V,0,9,"Just wanted to mention that some of what you said is only possible in the States/Canada, or other countries with actual Apple stores. So in my country for example there are no Apple techs, and you sure as hell aren‚Äôt getting an entirely new phone unless you buy one.

I still prefer iPhone (obviously) but it‚Äôs way easier and cheaper to get it fixed third party here, which I think is what most people do. We do have a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Apple reseller chain here which could probably do some repairing, but I believe it‚Äôs quite expensive",0
gz98awd,avengedjusty,0,2,"I thought this too. Why did you get thumbed down for this?‚Ä¶

Also you could just have your phone in your hand and the camera see you, unlock, and soon you‚Äôre opening a zillion apps, calling your mom, and buying a house on Zillow all at once because you aren‚Äôt aware the phones unlocked.",0
gz98fs6,-K9V,0,1,"Well Apollo isn‚Äôt buggy as hell, but if you don‚Äôt like the layout there‚Äôs not much to do about that. There‚Äôs a good bunch of Reddit clients on the App Store nowadays though so maybe browse through those, I know there are some really nice ones.",0

I already pay for it every year, and you can get 1tb of storage instead of 100gb if you choose to not have Photoshop in the subscription.

Everyone chooses their poison. Remember when Apple had to halt the practice of contractors listening in to users on Siri? Yikes

I still trust Apple the most with my data but Apple still isn't perfect, and their marketing is the best of them all. In the end it's all about $$$",0

gz9cwpr,melodic_crab_1968,0,2,"1. Phones are not investment. Just a work expense. 

2. Android phones get exchanged because free updates to later Android versions capped at 3 years.

3. Google is moving chip production in-house to avoid that 3 year update limitation. 

My work phone is iPhone, personal, Android. The iPhone stays on charger all day. Don't use it much. 

On average, iPhones are better hardware than average Android phones including Samsung. Google phones are close competitors.

However, iOS isn't appealing to me. But that is personal preference.",0
gz9dc9s,darevx,0,6,"Even for my moderate to heavy usage, my 2017 iPhone X still performs very well. Surely not as fast as newer iPhones, but it doesn‚Äôt lag whatsoever. I believe it will still work okay for at least the next two major iOS releases. Or three. Battery‚Äôs still at 88% idk how I manage to keep it that good.",0
gz9dv33,Scarface74,0,2,"I don‚Äôt take that many pictures in the grand scheme of things.  Of course I have to pay for more storage for iCloud just because of the other uses of iCloud with iOS. 

I‚Äôm just going to let old photos sit there in Google once I run out of space. I will delete the ones I don‚Äôt care about. But I won‚Äôt go out of my way to keep free space. 

I pay for Office 365. You get 1 TB of space a piece for up to 6 users. It will be awhile before I use up 1 TB. When I do, I‚Äôll have my wife share her 1 TB and I will use that.",0

It was also weak compared to the SE 2016, despite costing ‚Ç¨150 more than the SE. You can make the same comparison between the XR and the SE 2020, but the performance differences are minimal, they both have the same amount of RAM, they both can record 4K videos and the XR makes up for being ‚Ç¨100 more expensive by having better battery life.

I accidentally locked myself out of my Google account of 10+ years last year and was never able to recover my password. If Google Photos had been my solution for photo storage I'd have lost it all without a backup or anything. 

I went back to iPhone for different reasons but much prefer iCloud over Google Photos, even if the latter is miles ahead in absolute features. What Google doesn't get is that I don't want everything in the cloud or at least *exclusively* in the cloud.",0

Apple support also perpetually ignores that in store employees made fun of a disability I have to my face, despite it having been escalated before, due to the problems you mention here where trying to *actually* get someone that can do anything being damn near impossible.

gz5b4h2,Jedilove1977,0,1,I never worked for AT&amp;T I did work for Verizon Wireless though at a call center. If a phone is on a stolen list likely an insurance claim was against it which means the insurance company technically owns the phone. Possibly the person who stole it went to an apple store to get it put on their service the phone was found out it was on the list and they left the phone it wasn't sent to the insurance company and it was just on accident put into the replacement stock.

Previously, the only watches to get Spotify offline support were Garmin (not competitive with Apple Watch/WearOS), and Samsung's Galaxy Watches (Tizen, direct competitor). I suspect that Samsung had an exclusivity deal to prevent this feature going to the Apple Watch and WearOS. Well, it was just announced that Tizen is being merged into WearOS.

So, my theory is that it was a Samsung-exclusive deal that became null and void once Tizen began merging officially into WearOS.",0

You weren‚Äôt left out necessarily. You still got 14.5 day 1. That feature just doesn‚Äôt work the way you want for your device. I do agree that it should still unlock the same way regardless of touch or Face ID with the watch. This whole last year has thrown these tech companies some big challenges. The future of what will be important hardware wise is still uncertain too. I have frustrations with Apple still but I prefer their ecosystem overall to Android. Less variables and it all works together smoothly.,0

Yes the PS has a webbrowser, but no reasonable person would argue that people use it as a general purpose device. It's nearly exclusively used for gaming and it's obvious that this is its main purpose.

We have spectrometers in our lab that have a built in internet connection. All of the points you've listed would be fitting as well, but no reasonable person would assume that this is a general purpose device.

One thing that I realized is that I didn't really use kustom for the functionality, I mainly used it to get reasonably good looking widgets - because the default widgets by those apps (if they existed) look like shit on Android; more than a few looked like they hadn't changed since holo design.

Idk how he continues to make mistakes like that. In his 12 Pro review I think he said the phone still has a 7MP front camera when he compared it to the iPhone X. Wrong again. It has a 12MP front camera since the Xs or 11.

They go on this 10 minute rant/discussion where they super excited about how Tim Cook accidentally leaked the iPhone X before it was announced and how it was obvious because of the different camera bump.

Only thing is, that happened after the iPhone X was announced. Just before it was out in stores, meaning nothing was leaked since Apple had already announced it.

Apple charges a 15-30% toll for subscriptions from competing products, while not being subject to the same overhead themselves. That is in fact a form of gatekeeping. It is demonstrably true, the exact opposite of false.

If apple had to charge itself 15-30% on subscriptions to its service, what proportion would that be of its actual overheads. Nothing is the answer. More bad faith from you

&gt;ry debating in good faith for a change. It's more productive for both sides.

yawwn. Try just debating and not using this spurious bad faith nonsense. Which is in itself a bad faith tactic

&gt; But, Apple isn't charged by another company for Apple Music the way that Spotify is.

Its immaterial where the overheads come from. They exist and it is perfectly right for spotify to pay its share

&gt;Compared to Apple keeping their entire $9.99. That gives Apple an advantage in paying for content.

Firstly, long before AM existed, Spotify never had a business model that worked. Secondly, their business model has been a complete failure  in fostering the development of new talent. Apparently you're also not ware that apple pays a bigger cut to labels. Lastly, the sub-basic accounting you've applied is laughable.

&gt;Apple isn't beating Spotify by innovating. They're beating them with 

Are they beating Spotify?

I can agree with clean but futuristic yet retro is a bit of a stretch to describe their range. They did release a lot of junk over the years. They always were renowned for having huge bezels so Im not sure how that could be futuristic design.",1

gyx5m3g,UsePreparationH,0,1,The S6 was released a few months before Gear VR was released and a lot of the experimental android VR was taking off where high res displays really mattered. Now higher refreshrate makes a bit more of a difference in day to day usage over the higher pixel density since people really aren't using VR anymore. Companies now would rather just save money to cater to the majority of people who just don't care about anything other than the +1 on the phone generation because S21 is a bigger number than S20. Personally I have 1440p120hz and love it but I only got my phone due to really good trade in deals and would never pay $1200 MSRP out of pocket.,1

iOS works just as well as Android in most respects, or you could say that Android works just as well as iOS. That one or the other is 'garbage' or 'unusable' speaks more to someone not knowing how to use certain features, or that they're using a really shitty phone.

gyt601b,experpernectu,0,4,"&gt; She does go on to say planned obsolescence was a factor though,

The iPhone 5s was supported for *six years*, more than three times as long as Android flagships released the same year.

Android flagships *bought to replace Android flagships* released the same year as the iPhone 5s because they were no longer supported, had their support end two or more years before the iPhone 5s support ended. In fact, if you abandon a phone when its manufacturer does, you would have gone through three whole generations of Samsung Galaxy phones in the time you went through one iPhone 5s. For this example, I'm talking about OS updates, not security updates, which both Apple and Samsung phones get after they stop getting OS updates.",0

Not saying that Apple's appstore is much better though, their judgements seem pretty arbitrary, they are downright incompetent at communicating rules/requirements and they constantly play favorites with certain developers.

The Surface Duo was announced in October 2019, and [Panos Panay said they'd been working on the hardware for three years at that point](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20896114/microsoft-surface-duo-neo-android-event-panos-panay-interview-vergecast). 

The hardware itself was ready, but Andromeda was cancelled and the Surface team repurposed the device to run Android. By all indications, [even this was a difficult process](https://www.protocol.com/surface-duo-history).

To circle back to my point: due to the Andromeda project being cancelled after the Surface Duo hardware was ready, it was a last second decision to use Android to salvage the hardware, and the issues with the device illustrate this.",1

But for someone who recently purchased a device, that would be disappointing even if the watch as it is was already worth the purchase.

Second to that is another aspect that contributes to the disappointed feeling: as a consumer, those who bought Tizen devices did so because it was the best (for them) at that moment.

gyo5p3d,Carighan,1,5,"But let me note something about Fitt's Law in particular:

See the screenshots of the notification shade. Imagine you want to access your **third** notification, first is from, say, Reddit, second is Telegram, third is WhatsApp.

In the old design, I just pull down the shade, then tap on the notification.

In the new design, I saw the popup, I see the icon, but when I open the notification shade, **I cannot see a WhatsApp notification at all**. It's down below the bottom of the screen, and I'd have to scroll there. Without anything indicating to me that this is a scrollable pane to begin with.

Now of course, this seems simple to me:

1. Improve the UX of using quick settings.
2. Worsen the UX of accessing notifications.

It's a trade-off, after all. Like everything is. But importantly I'm not sure I get the specific choice. For me personally at least, I rarely if ever use my quick settings. Stuff is left on, I only ever need airplane mode / vibrate for well, certain social settings or when on, well, a plane.

But I access notifications **constantly**. It feels odd to me, if anything I would have thought they'd go the other direction and move the quick controls entirely out of there and say, into a power button menu or something. Maximum space and ease of use for what feels a way more constant part of daily smartphone use, notifications.

Again, I want to point out: This isn't a **gain**. As you describe it. I mean for a certain element it is. It's a **tradeoff** however, as a whole. That space and ease of access comes from somewhere, after all. In this case, by making notifications less visible and more difficult to access.",1

Suppose you want to pay for parking somewhere and the way you pay is through an app. They probably have an app that will let you pay for parking but that same app probably does a lot of other things. It probably has a map of the parking lot, contact information, details about the area, etc. You probably don't want to waste your time and data downloading their whole app with all that unnecessary stuff just for this one off payment you need to make. 

So app clips are supposed to be a thing where that company can make a tiny version of their app. It won't require much data to download and it only does the one thing you need it to (i.e. process a parking payment). Also, once you're done, you don't have to find that app in your library and delete it. 

So it's basically trying to make those kind of situations more convenient and more efficient.",0

Compared to the 3GS, the 4 not only introduced a front facing camera, but also a better rear camera, HD video recording, a flash that can also be used with video recording, a sharp display with PPI exceeding 300, better Bluetooth support, and twice the amount of RAM. The iPhone 4 was the first iPhone I would have considered getting, and only because I was 16 and couldn‚Äôt afford it that I never got it. But if I had the money to buy the 5 in 2012, I would have bought the 4s and been happy with it. In fact, the 4s was more groundbreaking than the 5, because the 4s introduced FaceTime over 3G, as well as a dual core processor, both GSM and CDMA bands, proper antennas, an 8 megapixel camera, full HD video recording and a 64GB storage option.

gyfsw5h,BigBrownHole36,0,1,"I got more enjoyment out of my iPhones that I did out of my Android phones. I had three Android phones: a Sony Xperia J that had a weak processor so it lagged and became unbearable to use six months after I got it; a Sony Xperia E3 which only came with 4GB of storage, of which only 700mb was available to the user because of the OS and because of apps you cannot delete, so it was unusable; and a HTC Desire 620, which got slow after 9 months but still better than the Xperia J, and whose battery went to shit 11 months in. However, all these Android phones were cheap. If I had a Samsung Galaxy S3, a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact or a HTC One M8 I would have been happy with these phones. But I did like the iPhone's FaceTime and iMessage features, their software optimisations, their long shelf lives and their extensive years of software support. So while iPhones and high end Android phones have comparable hardware, I prefer iPhones. Plus, I have an iPad and I love it. So when the iPhone 7 came out, Apple dropped the price of the 6s and doubled the storage options, so I bought a 32GB 6s. I kept it for a year, gave it to my sister and now I have a 256GB 8 Plus. Then my sister gave the 6s to my brother after she got a new iPhone, and my brother kept it until it broke. By which point, my sister got new iPhone and my brother got her older one.

In hindsight, I wished I got the 6s+ 128GB. I would probably still have it or have gotten the 12 recently. 32GB wasn‚Äôt enough for me and having optical image stabilisation is essential. But the 6s was still a good phone, and my sister and brother loved it.",0

Iris scanner was super finicky to use, failed most of the time if there was direct sunlight hitting the phone, and had a super narrow angle so you had to point the phone directly to your eyes. That's why they would show you this live image of your eyes on screen for you to align to, which made it all the more cumbersome. It was slow and unreliable. The only reason I kept it on was because the fingerprint reader was also horrible, as is always the case with Samsung phones, so *sometimes* it would save me from having to use that.

How Samsung of all OEMs could fail so miserably at biometrics every single year on their 1000‚Ç¨+ phones while 200‚Ç¨ phones from other brands do it just fine is beyond me, really.

The Pixel 4's 3D scanner is simply flawless. It's even slightly faster than the iPhone's face ID system, which makes sense since the Pixel 4 uses a dual (stereo) system while the iPhone uses a mono one. Fast, reliable, convenient. You forget it's there.

My only complaint with it is that it doesn't allow you to register an alternative look, which means it's been a pain to use when wearing a mask over the last year.

For me the ideal combination would be a reliable 3D face unlock system + an under display fingerprint reader (a reliable one, not a Samsung one). But I assume most OEMs will simply drop face unlock given how difficult it would be to fit both into the phone + the whole covid situation with masks.",1

gyfaoia,defet_,0,2,"If I'm remembering our conversation correctly I mentioned the 1/‚àö2 factor on a single-axis resolution to be PenTile's *worst-case* resolution (analog to striped RGB) with color mixtures that completely exclude green. This is because excluding green subpixels leaves only the red and blue subpixels, which have half (1/2) the amount of *total* subpixels (compared to striped RGB) , which is a factor of ‚àö(1/2) pixels along one axis. However, it's actually very rare that green is completely excluded so in hindsight this computation isn't very practical to use, although it is truly the worst case.

You can find the factor for the typical case (including the full-resolution green subpixels) by computing the average amount of subpixels per color along one dimension:

\-Half (1/2) the amount of red and blue subpixels =&gt; ‚àö(1/2) along one dimension

\-Full (1) amount of green subpixels

&amp;#x200B;

( ‚àö(1/2) {red subpixels} + ‚àö(1/2) {blue subpixels} + 1 {green subpixels} ) / 3 {colors}

= ‚àö((2)+1)/3

&amp;#x200B;

Which is similar to the value that /u/Darkness_Moulded computed (‚àö(2/3) ), but that value assumes each color subpixel has 2/3 the amount of subpixels, which is not exactly the case.",1

When you send an sms or an email, you have no idea when the person has read it, or if they are responding. You could enable read receipts, but then your inbox will get filled with read receipts, and your contact will get pestered to send the read receipts whenever they open an Email. 

The appeal of instant messaging is that it's a greater level of connection. You can type out a message, see exactly when your contact opens the app and reads it, and get a little icon telling you when they are responding.

Actually, yes, it is. It's obvious the 7 and 7 Pro are from the same generation, and then the T obviously acts similar to Apple's S for example.

That's one hell of a reach.

&gt;Want a budget? Ok, xperia 10.

So these aren't number 5 and 10 phones? You've thrown away the naming scheme already?

&gt;I know American have a hard time with decimalization but c'mon.

I'm not American.

&gt;Want the latest generation? Cool, get the highest mark. Xperia 1 mark III is higher than mark II, so III is the latest. It's simple.

No it isn't. It's only simple once you already know it. If the average person walks into a shop and sees Xperia 1 II and Xperia 5, they would think the Xperia 5 was the newer better phone, because that's how literally everybody does it.",1

I would argue that a message should be sent across the industry so no one dares to exploit our low IQ brothers who don't know any good and are gullible enough to fall for these malicious marketing tactics.,1

gyaz148,RelativeOfJack,0,0,"Email is ""instant"" in as much as, (unless configured otherwise by the user and/or provider), the message is instantly sent from the sender's device, via the sender's email account, to the recipient's email account, then to the recipient's device. 

That part is identical to that which people call ""instant messaging"", the only difference being that the user can configure when the messages are sent and when they are received, if for some reason ""instant"" is deemed unwanted or unnecessary. 

&gt; The appeal of instant messaging is that ... You can ... see exactly when your contact opens the app and reads it, and get a little icon telling you when they are responding. 

Only if you are sitting watching the screen and only if your conversation partner(s), has enabled, (or left enabled), that functionality on their device(s). Many don't.

This ""feature"" is actually one of the most common reasons why people complain about such applications in my admittedly limited experience. 

They become stressed and/or anxious if their message goes unread or if it isn't replied to for what they deem to be an unacceptable period of time.  

They don't experience the same stress or anxiety when using email, (although many of them do experience stress and anxiety because of their choice of provider, their choice of how they access their email and their inability to efficiently manage their account). 

&gt; You could enable read receipts, but then your inbox will get filled with read receipts, and your contact will get pestered to send the read receipts whenever they open an Email. 

This is both correct and incorrect. Essentially it is optional. 

There are email clients available which automatically transmit requests and receipts, (and these can be configured to dump/move them as deemed appropriate by the user, or indeed they can be disabled altogether).

Additionally, a decent email client will also allow you, the user, via the settings, modify all settings regarding read receipts, leaving it up to the user whether or not to request them, to see such requests and to respond to such requests.

Furthermore, if the user ""opts-in"", a decent email client and/or provider will have the option to periodically clear, (delete/move), any read receipts generated both automatically and manually, if the user wishes to do so. 

&gt; Email is a ... more formal method of communication

Once again, that is down to the user and their choices/perception.

It can be formal, it can be informal, it can be both.",1

gy74tiu,eh_ovo_nct,0,1,"Hello, i'm a broke student so i'm debating on what I should buy. iPhone 11 or iPad air

I already own an iPhone 7 but the battery health is currently at 50% and I still haven't had a chance to change the batteries because I can't go out. I'm honestly surprised that it's still working till now lol.

I want an iPad air so I can do my schoolworks easily because I find my laptop (Lenovo) hassle. We have a MacBook m1 but it's not mine (it belongs to my sister. although I can use it sometimes) I still want my own personal gadget. Because of online classes I have to often use my Lenovo laptop even though I don't want to so i'm thinking if buying an iPad as an alternative.

I just want an iPhone 11 so I can take pretty pictures.. iPhone 12 is much more pricey so I thought iPhone 11 will do. I use my phone everyday mostly for social media and when I go out I like to take a lot of pictures so I wanted a phone that has a battery that could last long so I don't have to bring my charger everywhere.

Do you prefer not having everything you do on the Internet tracked and remembered by hundreds of companies who will sell this data to anyone who wants it, including potential future employers who may base giving you a job on your internet search history, or do you want ads that are slightly more relevant to you?

I mean none of this is accurate but ok. Twitter, google, etc - none of them sell your data. And I‚Äôve definitely never heard of google selling your browsing history to employers. I mean that‚Äôs just insane. 

The more pertinent question is, do you want services like Twitter to stay free? Because the way they generate revenue is by charging brands for ads. The less information they have about the end user, the less they can charge for their ads. If ad revenues drop they will be forced to go to some kind of freemium model.",0

Just because a few nay-sayers want to spread fear by telling people how bad things are going to get if companies can't get their free user data and we'll all have to start paying for services, it won't actually turn out like that.

The thing is Facebook could survive without targeted marketing. It's just their bottom line would be hit badly and that's why they're being so noisy about it, sending people on to sociable media sites to spread messages of panic.

So what if they start charging people to make up the difference? Then another social media company comes along and says, ""We'll do it for free like Facebook used to be but we'll just make do with the non-targeted ad revenue. Then everyone moves to them and Facebook dies. Free market baby. Bye bye Facebook.

Facebook and Twitter and all the rest will NEVER charge users. They know that'd be the death of their company as there are plenty of social media sites nipping at their heels that would LOVE Facebook to start charging so they can undercut them.",0

THAT is how the free market works.

How will that other social media platform survive? By non targeted ads. There‚Äôs still more than enough money in non targeted ads for a social media platform to make money. They just won‚Äôt make the billions that used to be in it.

So here‚Äôs the free market outcome of all this: Either Twitter, Facebook and their like are going to have to live with lower revenues or they‚Äôre going to try and charge a subscription to make up the costs and by doing that they‚Äôll lose market share to social media platforms that are content to make the lower revenue from non targeted ads.",0

The rest of the market is Oneplus (not a fan), and then the bloatware traps like Mi, Oppo, Vivo, and then Moto/Lenovo and Nokia/Hmd a.k.a the strugglers. I for one really miss brands like Sony and HTC, but they never really solidified themselves in the market and wanted to price themselves like Samsung and Apple despite not having the loyalty or bothering to market as aggressively.

Personally I only use pixels, and I buy them from NYC via relatives residing there too save a few thousands. Though I'm eyeing an Asus device next, it's the brand I see as the next underdog, but they too, need to market aggressively or risk missing out on sales.",1

It doesn't matter if you do or don't for advertisers like me - the advertising manager in Reddit was designed around the Facebook Ads Manager, they are effectively identical.

There are less automated data points on Reddit, but I'd argue being able to scour someone's comment history gives me far greater insight than the anonymised data on Facebook. 

Also, deleting a facebook account is meaningless as Facebook creates shadow profiles on people who have never even had an account.

Always makes me giggle when people on Reddit, one of the world's largest social media websites, brag about quitting social media.",0

I‚Äôm looking for two induction charges for my stuff. I have iPhone 12 Pro, AirPods Pro and Watch Series 6. I want to have two induction charges, one for bedroom and one for office desk. 

That one from bedroom should cover iPhone and Watch charging, when office desk one should cover iPhone and AirPods Pro. If there is also some good 3 in 1 option, I can go with that. 

What charges could you recommend? Extra benefit will be possibility to have iPhone and Watch on regulated position (lay or stand), but it‚Äôs just as extra feature. Good option is to have charger with adapter, not only ‚Äúplate‚Äù without anything. 

Please recommend what are you using! Couldn‚Äôt find anything interesting here.

Thank you in advance!

garbage &gt; shit &gt; Facebook, Reddit &gt; Instagram &gt; Twitter &gt; TikTok

Reddit may have been cool and interesting 10 years ago, now it's a 90% hive mind made of soyboys and neckbeards, which has made this portal come down to a level where any opinion outside the brainless crowd is suppressed, most if not all big subreddits are in reality political biased cesspool (just look at e.g. r/pics) 

\*and its partly owned by China

Instagram isn't very invasive, except for ""influencers"" who think they are changing the world by showing their ass in photos. Overall, Instagram's management and moderation is just as retarded as Facebook's

It seems to me that twitter does not need to be explained, except for a few profiles, it is probably the most toxic community on the internet

gy2m7ml,Gundam_net,0,1,My thumb just reaches perfectly to the edge of the 4xl.  The xl phones are perfect to me.  Smallest I'd ever go is a Galaxy s10 size.,1
gy2m9ja,_gadgetFreak,0,2,That's the one I'm looking forward to.,1
gy2ma6x,rohithkumarsp,0,1,"that's the most unsettling bump if i've ever seen on, good luck lol",1
gy2mbiv,plad25,0,10,Volume down button is usually a shutter button in camera.. I use it all the time for one handed shot.,1
gy2ml34,finewhitelady,0,2,"Apple also shot themselves in the foot with the latest gen SE, much cheaper and has the fingerprint sensor but almost as small as the 12 mini. I would guess that a lot of people who wanted a small phone got that instead.

For what it's worth though, I upgraded my work IPhone 8 to the 12 mini. Aside from the very unfortunately timed loss of the fingerling sensor, I'm much happier with it. The slightly smaller size of the 12 mini has made it much easier for me to use, and I like looking at the low-bezel screen.",1
gy2mls5,JHTLP,0,0,"Looks slick, but also a bit dated. I thought at least the Pixels would hold on to the back fingerprint sensor. The phone is kind of unremarkable.",1
gy2mlti,haximal,0,13,You can use the volume button on the Pixel to take a photo. I'm sure Samsung has something similar.,1

gy2n05g,Hulksmashreality,0,-5,"Lol, some of your grips are justü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è like the whole squircles tirade (which you assume most Pixel users will complain about based on what data?) but different strokes. 

Smart View works with every TV I've ever tried, Samsung, LG, JVC, Web OS, Tizen, Fire OS, Android TV devices  etc., so don't know what you're on about there.",1
gy2n206,finewhitelady,0,4,"I'm absolutely shocked by a lot of the comments. I think the camera bump is hideous and expected to see it blasted (especially since /r/android has slammed phones with much smaller and less intrusive camera modules), but most people here are saying they like it...!?!",1
gy2n4xu,bucketbiff,0,1,I'd buy huawei again. Not zte tho won't do much buisness in the uk. People will lump for samsung or apple. Price point can bring you a s21 or a p30 pro with change. I known which i'd rather have...,1
gy2n6eq,parental92,0,3,he bought the book and read it.  not only try the book for 5 minutes and judge it.,1
gy2n8qu,ozymandiusz,0,1,Not gonna lie. It looks really good. But if I am not mistaken google removed unlimited high quality pictures from upcoming pixels so nope.,1
gy2ncl5,parental92,0,7,"because every time google implement a feature, it needs to be standardized so that the whole millions of phones across all EOM that will be able to use it. 

  


google make the cake mix, samsung adds frosting. it's easier to pack flashy frosting than making a great cake base.",1
gy2ncr1,Hulksmashreality,0,8,"You really DON'T have to customise more stuff than any other user that's moving from one OS (that's basically what Samsung's UIs are and would apply to almost all Android manufacturers) to another. Same way you would have to customise things when you move from stock Android to iOS and vice versa or from Windows to Mac or any of the Linux distros.

Also One UI does ""just work"".",1
gy2nfpg,ItsGermany,0,1,"I hate the way that guy talks and his video, so full of filler and junk! 

#don't watch, just jump to 50%",1
gy2ng7v,Votix_,0,20,Exactly. I don't understand why people would trust 2D face unlock,1
gy2nglz,Forest-Vibes,0,3,The status bar is already in two sections.,1
gy2njho,finewhitelady,0,3,The Zenfone 8 which was just announced should have everything you need except the SD slot.  For some reason SD slots have gotten rare again.,1
gy2nkiy,UESPA_Sputnik,0,5,A tiny but (for me) really annoying design decision that I noticed when I set up my mother's Samsung phone: when you swipe up from the bottom to open the app drawer it floats into the screen from the top downwards. That makes no sense.,1
gy2nm86,TheTurnipKnight,0,1,Google what the hell have you done,1
gy2nmbi,StraY_WolF,0,14,That's just the cost of wireless charging.,1
gy2np4x,parental92,0,2,"yep, pretty much my experience with one UI.

It's amazing that you can customize many things but that's about the end of it. Sheer number of features without regard of consistency.

&amp;#x200B;

on the other hand i'm so glad google is taking only the best ideas from one ui and implement  it to pixel ui.",1
gy2nrtn,Hulksmashreality,0,7,"I think ONE UI looks miles better than stock, in fact I've preferred most of Samsung's UIs to anything Google has released on Android. It's the reason why I can never use stock ROMs for more than a few days, they're ugly and basic. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
gy2nyne,BrownThunderMK,0,1,If google uses their own SOC it might be much more easy for them to pull it off.,1
gy2nz9k,madn3ss795,0,4,"&gt; Pixel 4 has full array 3D sensor , its not even comparable to samsung implementation.

If we're going back in time, anyone compared Pixel 4 face scanner to Note 9 Iris scanner yet?",1
gy2o2we,MobiusOne_ISAF,0,2,"That's so comically false that it's kind of hard to take you seriously. Samsung is so ubiquitous that some people are honestly confused about the difference between an ""Android"" and a ""Samsung"", and those people are absolutely using it stock and just fine at that.

OneUI is fine, the people who act like it's some kind of labyrinth are practically hunting for differences and labeling them as ""problems"" instead of what they are, different design choices.",1
gy2o43g,PopWhatMagnitude,0,1,"Like it better than most camera bumps but really seems like it's going cause issues with car holders that have wireless charging. Or home ones that hold the phone standing up. 

The little puck ones should be just fine though.",1
gy2o8x2,punIn10ded,0,9,It's already been confirmed by other leakers too.,1
gy2od5j,parental92,0,2,"yep i had note 9 as a work phone for awhile. 

the reason why i don't use them is because it's harder to line up your eyes to the phone instead just putting the phone in front of your face.  BUT it IS more secure than janky 2D face unlock.",1
gy2ofu4,finewhitelady,0,9,"I agree with basically all of this.  One UI is ugly, sure, but the alternative isn't really that much better.  The cartoonish look of the latest One UI updates is something I complain about a lot.  But when push comes to shove I'll choose function over form every time, and the degree of customization we have with Good Lock and built-in features (like changing the nav bar button order) outweighs the ugly design.  The S10e is my first Samsung since the Galaxy Nexus, and I know I'll certainly miss these customization features if/when I go with a different brand next, which is actually quite likely given how Samsung keeps removing hardware features, but that's another story for another thread.",1
gy2og1c,MittenFacedLad,0,0,"I'm getting Nexus 6p vibes. (google doing some design echos between series 6 devices?)
Which is great.
That phone was gorgeous and unique in person.",1
gy2ojrk,real_sadboi,0,4,The UK is still geographically considered Europe.,1
gy2oosg,real_sadboi,0,1,"The regular Zenfone 8 will be released later this year in the US, the Flip will not.",1
gy2ouf8,finewhitelady,0,1,"&gt; ASUS said they don't want people to think the bigger model is necessarily better

As someone who prefers compact devices, I really appreciate hearing this.  It has always bothered me that manufacturers give the bigger phones better hardware, which incentivizes buying the bigger one, and then they turn around and say ""small phones don't sell.""",1
gy2ovoy,captnkerke,0,13,"If you like accessing these things through a browser, then you might want to take a look at Hermit also:

No, you are not the only one.",1
gy2pag4,finewhitelady,0,2,"I agree, 148mm tall is not compact, and being smaller than other devices in a relative way doesn't make it compact in an absolute way.  I wish they could have reduced the screen size enough to get it under 140.  It's hard enough to reach the top corners of my S10e (142mm).",1

gy2qaa0,boxfishing,0,12,I never realized how behind windows was with audio handling compared to MAC OS until I tried to setup multiple microphones in windows. Not having native support for multiple USB IN audio devices is insane. No wonder the music industry leans towards apple. Here's hoping it continues to improve.,1

This means the 5% of revenue that Facebook loses will turn into around 20% or even more. Not to forget that Facebook tells you that letting them collect that type of data helps them keep Facebook free if charge. If people stop allowing them to collect data Facebook may make it's products a paid service. This decision will completely affect Facebook as from what I know no one is willing to pay for services such as Facebook.

gxya4gv,youwillcometobrazil,0,5,"I understand where the person you replied to came from.

You can see in some videos, the phone activates a gaming / performance mode that prioritizes just that when it detects the user has opened a benchmark app. It's not something hidden btw, it's literally a popup telling you that, so part of me thinks this is just an oversight. This is probably why it scores so much above any other SD888 phone on geekbench.

About the throttling, honestly it's expected for a flagship 2021 SoC in a compact body. If the user does not notice it or the phone never even triggers the throttling during normal usage, that's good. Not even Apple could bend the laws of physics with their mini, and it's something that compact phone fans are acutely aware of. But I wish they give the user some control about that, like ""do you prioritize thermals or performance?"".",1

gxu0g0d,sportsfan161,0,1,Well phoned like ultra i think are far better designed and look like 2021 devices. We know apple will get there in the end with a similar design but they always take longer,0
gxu0owq,ToffeeMunchAndCrunch,0,2,My S10+ has a 4100mah battery and feels much lighter than the iPhone 12 which is both smaller and has a smaller battery.,0
gxu0qcl,ToffeeMunchAndCrunch,0,1,Probably September like most years,0
gxu1579,sportsfan161,0,1,Pros and cons to both but i use a pro max and s21 ultra as wanted best of both worlds. Android certainly offers more features and ultra for example you get the most tech in one phone but depends on your OS of choice,0

gxu9knk,NikeSpeltBackwards,0,1,"Thanks. 

Would all those last through software updates pretty much the same? That‚Äôs another consideration I‚Äôve got. I don‚Äôt want to end up having to change in 3 years say, if I could keep the slightly more expensive one for 4 years

gxubsa6,Eddytion,0,5,They lost all credibility when they sold points to multiple Chinese companies.,0
gxuccjk,ajb9292,0,1,Weight yes a tiny bit but really not enough to even notice without holding it next to another device but balance no if anything it would be more balanced.

Keyboard numbers and symbols a pain to use.

Notifications disappears from Lock Screen if you unlock the phone 

Settings for apps are in settings app instead of in the apps themselves

Keyboard backspace button is inconsistent

Hiding keyboard is inconsistent, and changes between even Apple apps, and even within the same app. Sometimes you have to click outside the keyboard, sometimes you need to swipe down outside the keyboard, sometimes you need to click a dedicated cancel button. These are mutually exclusive, so you need to guess which one will work in any given situation

gxtwk28,JustCallMeBen,0,1,"&gt; Where does port forwarding come into play with a service like Synology?

It's important to note that port forwarding is only needed if you want to accept incoming connections from outside your network. So say your phone accessing your NAS to see your pictures or movies: your phone is the one that first contacts your NAS, it needs to do so on a specific port on your NAS, and to reach that port from outside your own wifi, you end to set up port forwarding.

Some stuff simply runs on your NAS and you do not need port forwarding: for example I have an application on my NAS that syncs certain data with OneDrive. This is initiated by my NAS, so it does not need port forwarding.

&gt; I don't have to worry about it if I am going to use Quickconnect

Correct! Quickconnect gets around the problem by having your NAS initiated a connection with Synology their servers, and keeping that connection open (think of it as a phone call). When you access your NAS, you simply access the synology servers, and they relay everything over that open connection (including the login: you log in directly to your NAS, not on the synology servers). You don't need to worry about ports either: you can access any port of your NAS this way: the Synolgy server will simply 'tell' your NAS over that open connection ""this is what I was send for you at port x"".",1

gxu0odu,Carighan,1,11,"I'm constantly flip-flopping between GBoard and SwiftKey now.

On paper, SwiftKey feels unusable to me:

* Automatic space after punctuation and I cannot turn this off. It's so weird because it breaks flow badly that I need to type the space after a letter than ends a word, but not if I type a comma right after. I wish they'd have made this an option.
* Emoji are tiny in the picker. My eyesight isn't that good any more, and I wonder how difficult it can possibly be to see how much more easy they are to discern at the size GBoard renders them and simply copy that...
* Speaking of which, SwiftKey not having a search field for emoji is just... no. Yes, sure, it tries to auto-predict what I meant from a word. But there are **so many** emoji that fit words like ""hand"", ""flag"" or ""wind"", **just let me search for it!**. I mean the tech is clearly there already internally, the user just has no access to it.
* The keyboard feels laggy to use. This is just perception due to the delay in the UI reacting to taps (even though the letter is output immediately), but it's annoying and makes me pause.

However... and this is the thing... **unlike** GBoard, SwiftKey can actually swipe and/or predict and correct words. It can do the mixed english/german I need for much of my day. It can learn abbreviations. It knowns how to capitalize words in german. Its autocorrect is actually a help, not a hindrance.

gxpvik8,Enginair,0,1,"Reposting what I wrote a couple months ago:

Notifications:

-	Why are they hidden from me on the lockscreen after I unlock my phone?
-	Better grouping - grouping is a mess and allows for notifcations for the some chat to be split across 2 sections on the lockscreen - why?
-	Have an option not to wake the screen when a notification is received 
-	Allow me to hear a notification on my phone if I'm wearing earphones and wearing a watch. When out walking you don't always feel your watch vibrate and I find it so stupid I can't have the notification in your ears. The fact it‚Äôs an option only if you have AirPods or beats is ridiculous. 
-	I wish I could tell by looking at the status bar if there's a notification waiting for me
-	In summary - more like Android


One handed Use

-	There needs to be an improvement in gestures for one handed use. After recently moving from an S10+ to an 11 Pro max I noticed apple is severely lacking in one handed usability.


Media Control

-	On Android when using Spotify for example it was a bar with controls sitting with my notifcations. If I happened to play a clip on twitter or on YouTube I could go to my notifications afterwards and click play again
-	On ios everything is handled by the media player in control centre. If I play something on twitter I have to open the Spotify app again to start playing.
-	Clicking play when nothing is queued should not start playing a random track from the music app unless it was the last one I used.


Screen

-	The floating window/split screen on my s10 was really useful. The iPhone 11 has no reason not to have it as well
-	Why doesn‚Äôt my bigger 11 pro max screen allow me to see more content than compared to a 11 pro? The UI shouldn‚Äôt be blown up, it should show more.",0

The same is true with Gboard.  Good saves keystrokes.  It's why on the iPhone, even if you use Gboard, it only allowed the native keyboard when you put in passwords.",0
gxpxgag,Mathlete86,0,1,"I switched last year. I wish someone would've told me that podcast management is an absolute joke. Why are so few podcast apps supporting batch management of podcast episodes? Like if I want to select 10 episodes and add to the playlist so many apps only let you select one episode at a time. It's so convoluted and messy. And that doesn't even get into how abysmal Apple's own podcast app is. It's the worst of the bunch!

I listen to a lot of podcasts at work so this is a big thing for me and I'll take this time to promote Pocket Casts. It's the best podcast app I've come across because it allows you to select multiple episodes at a time (and even has the option to select all episodes above or below a point of your choosing) to add to a playlist, archive/mark as played, etc. It absolutely blows my mind that more podcast apps on iOS don't support features like that when some podcasts have hundreds of episodes. No one wants to go through a few hundred episodes one at a time.",0

IOS has improved greatly and I love the widgets that allow you to customize your phone and gain productivity (at least I use widgets for that purpose). The only thing I regret is the feeling of having a slightly smaller smartphone in terms of screen and notch. As well as Face ID with the masks, it's super annoying to have to enter your code every time you use it (if you have an Apple Watch, it can solve this problem).

Well, from my perspective working at IT, defending against leakage is more important. We don't use Intune though and use VMware Intelligent Hub instead. For Android, everything is installed and done inside Work Profile, including separate Office applications, email, etc along with completely separate storage. Its easier to explain for BYOD users with clearer separation and for offboarding, user can just un-enroll and everything inside Work Profile will be gone without touching Personal. For iOS though, they don't have concept of separate apps or separate storage so enrolling BYOD devices means that we may need to manage some of the personal apps which means during un-enrollment process, some users personal files might end up be deleted as well.",1

gxkyzgx,sandnesj,1,3,"I switched to iPhone last year after having a Samsung and I'm definitively switching back next year. I just experience everything being a little harder to do. 

Editing photos takes a long time, my phone can't handle the Lighroom app like my Samsung could. The battery isn't as good, it gets overheated way too fast so the screen goes all dark. 

Apple has good security, but almost too good. I used 6 months logging OUT of my account because I forgot my password. You have to write your password to log out... I wonder why? And changing password was a hassle when you don't remember your old one. üòÖ 

They said an email would come in the next few days and when I got it  week later there was all these steps you had to do, like fill in childhood street, childhood pet, etc. I failed, for some reason. And had to do it all over again many times. üòÇ 

Samsung is overall just easier in my opinion. I guess it depends on your needs and preferanses! ‚ò∫Ô∏è The new iPhone's are probably a lot better tho, battery wise.",0
gxkz2zm,PutYourShoesOnNow,0,10,"I‚Äôve switched between Android and iOS more times than I can remember - all the way back from the the iPhone 3G through HTC Desire, Galaxy S, right the way up to more recently the S10e and currently the iPhone X (with about 15 other models in between).

The easiest way to put it is that everything you have heard is basically true.

iPhones run faster, smoother, more consistently than comparable Androids, and continue to do so for at least 3 generations longer than any android would. No slow down, no ui stutter, no sudden pauses before it does anything. Apps are generally superior, less buggy, and the store has far less trash and useless ad filled clones than the play store.

On the other hand android gives you more freedom to customise, has better notifications, lets you install 3rd party stores and it‚Äôs easier to copy files to. However that‚Äôs at the expense of fluidity, privacy and security., and you almost certainly won‚Äôt get 3 years of updates for it.

In my experience, iOS is far superior unless you have a specific need to customise, or use some niche app that you can only get on android. I‚Äôm using an iPhone X at the moment, which is almost 2 years older than my old s10e, but in terms of performance and usability, the iPhone is way ahead (although the camera on the s10e was great).",0

Notifications on iOS suck. Also no YouTube Picture in Picture but from what I understand is that‚Äôs on Google/YouTube.

I didn't even use the app, apple has made for switching to iPhone. You just log in with your google account and all your contacts are there and basically every single one of the apps you use, stores your information in their clouds so you just log into whatever app you used on android and everything is there. 

The only real issue I had was transferring whatsapp messages to my iPhone. And for that I bought a programme from here [https://www.backuptrans.com/index.html](https://www.backuptrans.com/index.html)

gxhc0oc,bithakr,0,1,"Upgrades:

* Screen technology upgraded from Retina HD to Retina XDR. Ceramic shield glass supposedly more drop-resistant. Resolution is very marginally higher.
* 5G support
* A12 -&gt; A14 CPU
* Battery: per apple's numbers you'd go from 15 -&gt; 17hrs video playback. Capacity wise its actually going down from 3174 mAh to 2815 mAh. Pro is the same exact battery, Pro Max is 3,678 mAh.
* MagSafe (magnetically attached mounts, and an Watch-esque puck style charger than snaps on magnetically. Older wireless charges still work fine)
* Roughly a 25% weight reduction
* Night mode and deep fusion features in the Camera app
* Wide camera has a larger sensor and works better in low light (on the Pro Max, the wide sensor is huge and features more advanced stabilization technology).
* Front camera upgraded to 12MP and supports 4K video.
* WiFi 6 (more of a futureproofing thing, but if you have fast home internet youll eventually want to get a wifi 6 router someday as they become more prevalent).
* U1 Chip (currently enables AirTag directional finding, CarKey, HomePod handoff, they probably have more things in store in future upgrades).

Downgrades:

* No Telephoto lens (unless you get Pro)
* 3D Touch (already weakened with software upgrades over the years. it is gone for good in the new iphones, to activate its features you just long press instead)
* Screen is smaller but will look just as sharp, the ppi is actually a tiny bit higher
* Aluminum frame (your XS has stainless-steel and so does 12 Pro)
* Flat sides arguably looks less fancy but some people prefer it, could go either way
* Storage starts at 64GB, so 256 is two tiers up. The Pro and Pro Max start at 128GB.

The iPhone Pro and Pro Max have a telephoto lens (2x, same as your XS, on the Pro, and 2.5x on the Max) and support taking ProRAW photos. The latter is not relevant for those who just like to take a picture and share it, but it is relevant for those who will do work in Photoshop/Lightroom/etc on the pictures and care about having the additional editing latitude. Pro also has a LIDAR scanner which is used to speed up focusing and portrait mode, iirc.",0

It wasn't a problem before, but this phone is so big that it's almost impossible to avoid.

That report literally showed them making even less sales then they did on the last report so it was even worse.

In fact the profit they made was 250k, useless chump change due to cutting spending and laying off. It's unfortunate, what they're doing isn't working at all. With that being said I hope they stick around and improve their phones.

Because it has an extra camera?

 &gt;Why would anyone in India buy the M2 Pro when the Redmi Note 9S/9Pro exists at the same price point and vice versa?

This one I agree, same phone. But one was launched after that India-China border skirmish which lead to somewhat negative sentiment towards companies from China so they used poco brand. 

&gt;There's still a price gap but I don't see the need for the Note 10 Pro and the Note 10 Pro Max in India when the Pro Max's camera upgrades aren't significant.

And what about soc? You don't see the difference b/w sd678 and sd732? Note 10 pro max also has dust and splash resistent. 

&gt;What's happening in the flagship segment is worse.

Flagship segment is always going to get worse because people are loyal to brands when they spend shit ton of money on them. So brands which operate in this segment would always try to get away with such tactics.

You seem to have made an error, the Note 10 is the only variant with the 678. The Indian variants of  the [Note 10 Pro](https://www.mi.com/in/redmi-note-10-pro/) and [Note 10 Pro Max](https://www.mi.com/in/redmi-note-10-pro-max/) are the exact same phone but the Pro has a 64 MP sensor while the Pro Max has a 108 MP sensor. The 108 MP sensor is extremely overhyped and does not produce noticeably superior results over the 64 MP sensor. They pulled off the same shit with the Note 9S/9 Pro and the Note 9 Pro/Pro Max last year where they were almost identical but the Note 9 Pro/Pro Max had a slightly superior camera sensor and NFC in some countries only to kill it with the Poco X3 NFC later.",1

This 1/1.7"" sensor is still fairly large for a phone, being 12Mp allows for quite large photo sites and much faster readout than others.

The larger high MP sensors have smaller photo sites,and much slower readout. They also mean everything is bigger and bulkier.

  


12Mp is the standard output for flagships, the 108Mp sensors are mostly made to give a 12Mp image with better dynamic range.

  


No other phone can do the same speed of object/eye tracking and capture, there's an unexplained description of how they are doing up to 4 frames stacked for the 20fps burst to improve low light performance.

  


If they went for a larger sensor they would have had to sacrifice speed and autofocus abilities.

For the entire camera setup, they're still fairly unique in having all 12Mp with completely manual options and raw across all sensors.",1

Wire does it, so it doesn't depend on the phone.


The computer app or phone app are on the same level, with independent encryption keys.
When you send a message, your phone (or desktop/web app) will encrypt a message for every device the receiver has, plus messages to your other devices.


So, if you have another 3 devices, and the person you're talking to has 5, you're basically sending 8 messages. Each message encrypted for each device.


It works great. But, as kinda expected, you don't get your chat history when logging in for the first time on a new device, for example. It starts blank, even though you had chat history on your phone. But after that, they're in sync.

I don't believe WhatsApp E2E are secure from Facebook. why would they do that, I don't think Facebook would miss a opportunity like this.

With two of my iPhones (12 Pro Max) the Find My iPhone icon arrow never goes away.  

Before I updated to IOS 14.5.1 this wasn't an issue as the arrow icon would only periodically show when it was transmitting my last location a few times a day.

I called Apple customer support and the first person I spoke with even noticed the icon arrow always being displayed was unusual.  

Apple the had a senior technician call me back to look at the problem.  The senior technician had no idea what I was trying to relay to her so I asked her to remotely connect to my iPhone so I could show her.  Well she connected remotely and still had no idea why the arrow icon is always displaying.  Then she said she doesn't have the arrow icon on her iPhone and that she isn't even using IOS 14.5.1 so she couldn't say for sure why it's there and to wait for a IOS update.  

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening with two of my iPhone 12 Pro Max phones?  Is this happening on your iPhone as well?",0

gx8z9pi,Carighan,1,3,"Ah, fair enough.

I've switched to Firefox again after some experimenting with Vivaldi. I think I actually like Vivaldi more from a pure ""workflow"" perspective, but it's also very resource hungry.

But Firefox just has many features at this point that are too crucial to get me through each day:

* uBlock Origin on mobile (while some browsers have integrated blockers, they're too limited and hence miss far far far too many things)
* On desktop, account containers alone genuinely made other browsers feel weird to use. Sure I could create multiple profiles, but the beauty is having two separate amazon accounts in two tabs side-by-side, or at work having the cookies for all the different versions of our software be fully separates while tabbing through them.
* Proper tracker blocking that's not half-arsed like in most browsers where you can either block all third party cookies or not, and of course if you do, plenty pages break.
* Given the advanced blocking, despite being slightly more slugging on raw load it actually ends up being faster in actual use since there's so much it never has to load and I never have to click away.

And then it doesn't really miss out on anything. I wish it had a sync like this thread is about, that'd be spiff, but OTOH it has sync, it has a really well-done reader mode, and I rarely have that use case. Nice as it'd have to be.

It's not without flaws, of course. You need an extension to swap your client string at least for Google or you run into issues with Google explicitly giving you a shitty version of their search because how-dare-you-not-use-Chromium. And given how little resources they have, there's some stuff they cannot do since they have to build a browser including the engine and all from scratch instead of just a UI + extras wrapper around a Chrome core.  
But eh, blocking + containers alone make it the best, IMO.",1
